Internships at MERL ===================== Internship1: TeraFlops at the
Leaves PI: Bill Butera (butera@merl.com) Recent many-core product
offerings are reshaping the field of embedded computing. On-die meshes
of light-weight processors have demonstrated dramatic gains in power
performance, with the caveat that the programming methods are both
novel, and application-specific. In this internship, we will
investigate perceptual computing on a sample of these next-gen
architectures. Of interest are applications that are a) compute bound,
b) inherently mobile, or c) requires close proximity between the
computing and the sensing ... preferably all three. The intent is to
code, test, &amp; characterize algorithms selected from ongoing machine
vision projects. The goal is quantify performance gains, articulate the
tradeoffs, build up a useful function library, and capitalize on MERL's
visibility within Mitsubishi Electric. Work flow: • install an IDE and
dev boards from one of the many-core vendors (TBD) • canvas MERL's
imaging projects, select algorithms • port algorithms to SW simulator,
test • port to algorithms to HW emulator, characterize • build up a
function library • write up results for publication. Skill set: •
strong SW/systems hacker capable of independent management of early-
rev development boards • experience in application development for
embedded systems. • background in machine vision algorithms a strong
plus. Summer internship at Mitsubishi Electric Research (MERL) PI:
Jonathan Yedidia, yedidia@merl.com Actor-based programming models for
parallel platforms Among the most pressing problems at the frontier of
computing is performance scaling via parallelism. How to get meaningful
applications to scale as the number of on-die cores moves into the
thousands ... A new project at MERL looks at implementing Actor-type
programming languages on distributed memory systems. The goal is to
develop programming methods that support performance scaling and to
demonstrate this on error-correcting codes as a first application. With
open questions on algorithms, macro-architectures, programming
languages, &amp; run-time environments, a core challenge is structuring
a project that is both path-breaking and manageable. We are looking for
a an energetic contributor to a diverse, dynamic team. If this is you,
it would be a great to work with you this summer. Skill set: • strong
coding skills in Java and/or Erlang a must. • experience in embedded
run time environments, hardware simulation, virtual machine design, are
all pluses. • familiarity with belief propagation also useful. • an ACM
Turing Award is welcome but not required (management insists that we
leave some room for professional growth). Mitsubishi Electric Research
Laboratories is the North American arm of the Corporate R&amp;D
organization of the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. Located in Kendall
Square, we conduct basic research and advanced development in computer
and communication technologies (more athttp://www.merl.com/projects/ ).
Rich in signal processing and machine vision expertise, MERL offers an
ideal environment for grounding silicon architecture development in
concurrency-friendly applications. </div>

For instance, a typical report on an industrial catastrophe describes
the improbable interplay between a succession of events. Each event has
a small probability and limited impact in itself. However, their
juxtaposition and chaining lead inexorably to the observed losses. A
common denominator of the various examples of crises is that they
emerge from a collective process: the repetitive actions of interactive
nonlinear influences on many scales lead to a progressive build-up of
large-scale correlations and ultimately to the crisis. In such systems,
it has been found that the organization of spatial and temporal
correlations does not stem, in general, from a nucleation phase
diffusing accross the system. It results rather from a progressive and
more global cooperative process occurring over the whole system by
repetitive interactions.<br>
<br>
For hundreds of years, science has proceeded on the notion that things
can always be understood--and can only be understood--by breaking them
down into smaller pieces, and by coming to know those pieces
completely. Systems in critical states flout this principle. Important
aspects of their behaviour cannot be captured knowing only the detailed
properties of their component parts. The large scale behavior is more
controlled by their cooperativity and scaling up of their interactions.
This is the key idea underlying the four examples that illustrate this
new approach to prediction: rupture of engineering structures,
earthquakes, stock market crashes and human parturition. </div>

What we can observe directly is the prevailing status of valuations and
the quality of market action. We can also look at more than a century
of market history and get an idea of what the return/risk profile of
the market has been, on average, given that prevailing evidence. As of
today – not two weeks ago, not two weeks from now, but today – the
prevailing status of valuations and market action is one that has
historically provided a strong average return/risk profile, but with
rare “outliers” that encourage us to retain a hedge several percent
below the current level of the market, strictly to insure against an
unlikely further breakdown. </div>

From my perspective, the whole issue of bull market versus bear market
doesn't get investors anywhere. Asking whether stocks are in a bull
market or a bear market is like asking Columbus what kind of trees are
planted along the edge of the earth. The question itself makes a false
assumption about how the world works. My view is that bull markets and
bear markets don't exist in observable reality – only in hindsight.
What gain is there to investing based on something that's unobservable
when you can manage your investments based on directly observable
evidence? </div>

This contradiction in ideas is, unfortunately but logically, reflected
in events in France. For example, Frenchmen have led all other
Europeans in obtaining their rights — or, more accurately, their
political demands. Yet this fact has in no respect prevented us from
becoming the most governed, the most regulated, the most imposed upon,
the most harnessed, and the most exploited people in Europe. France
also leads all other nations as the one where revolutions are
constantly to be anticipated. And under the circumstances, it is quite
natural that this should be the case.<br>
<br>
And this will remain the case so long as our politicians continue to
accept this idea that has been so well expressed by Mr. Louis Blanc:
"Society receives its momentum from power." This will remain the case
so long as human beings with feelings continue to remain passive; so
long as they consider themselves incapable of bettering their

Here I encounter the most popular fallacy of our times. It is not
considered sufficient that the law should be just; it must be
philanthropic. Nor is it sufficient that the law should guarantee to
every citizen the free and inoffensive use of his faculties for

demanded that the law should directly extend welfare, education, and
morality throughout the nation.<br>

men a regulation of labor, a method or a subject of education, a

positively upon people. It substitutes the will of the legislator for
their own wills; the initiative of the legislator for their own

deciding how much to charge, customer support, paying your bills,
getting customers to pay you, getting incorporated, raising money, and

“Scientists don’t know what they are talking about when they talk about
religion. Religion has nothing to do with belief, and I don’t believe
it has any negative impact on people’s lives outside of intolerance.
Why do I go to church? It’s like asking, why did you marry that woman?
You make up reasons, but it’s probably just smell. I love the smell of
candles. It’s an aesthetic thing.”<br>

Back in 19th century America, the Catholic Church took on the task of
changing the behavior of the poverty-stricken Irish immigrants, in
order to prepare them to rise in American society. As this
transformation succeeded, employers' signs that said "No Irish Need
Apply" began to disappear in the 20th century.<br>
<br>
The Jewish community likewise made many efforts to change the behavior
of immigrants from Eastern Europe, to enable them to better fit into
American society-- and to rise in that society.<br>
<br>
The Urban League and other black uplift groups made similar efforts to
prepare their fellow blacks to rise in American society. In fact, those
efforts began to pay off in dramatic reductions in poverty among
blacks, even before the civil rights laws of the 1960s.<br>
<br>
The unanswered question is why an approach with a proven track record,
not only in American society but in various other countries around the
world, has been superseded by a philosophy of tribal identity
over-riding issues of behavior and performance. </div>

Our process words stink. It's much easier for us when we think of an

making up the term object-oriented, because as soon as it started to be
misapplied, I realized that I should have used a much more
process-oriented term for it.—The Japanese have an interesting word,
which is called ma. Spelled in English, just ma. Ma is the stuff
in-between what we call objects. It's the stuff we don't see, because
we're focused on the nounness of things rather than the processness of
things. Japanese has a more process-feel oriented way of looking at how
things relate to each other. You can always tell that by looking at the
size of [the] word it takes to express something that is important. Ma
is very short. We have to use words like interstitial or worse to
approximate what the Japanese are talking about.</div>

Thank you Stan Young. I received vindication for the main idea of
Fooled by Randomness, the idea of false pattern detection that I later
developed into the narrative fallacy, which I summarize as follows:
statistical nonexperimental knowledge derived from looking at data is
bunk, partly since researchers are very likely to show spurious
patterns and regularities (or nonexperimental research leads to
pseudoknowledge). Technology makes false patterns easy to detect,
abundance of data make them more likely to be salient. If you have a
million random and unskilled traders, you will see many people with
Warren Buffet’s performance –all of whom, you would be told, “could not
have been doing so well out of randomness” and “have a statistically
significant performance”. If you look hard enough at large datasets you
will see some “nonrandom” regularity somewhere that will fool you, the
result of searching and testing and the immensity of the datasets now
available to us.<br>
<br>
Except that the vindication did not come from economists or
philosophers of science (these fields, I keep repeating...), but from
medicine. At the AAAS conference in San Francisco I was a discutant of
session in which John Ioannidis showed that 4 out of 5 epidemiological
“statistically significant” studies fail to replicate in controlled
experiments. 4 out of 5 epidemiological studies are fooled by
randomness! The epidemiologists worked hard on their computers until
they found an association between symptoms and identified possible
“causes”, and published the result for academic advancement. These
results, of course, will be reported in the newspapers –journalists and
your family doctor do not understand the difference between
back-testing and clinical trials. Another researcher, Peter Austin,
showed how he could find links between health symptoms and astrological
signs. (I once showed students that if you generate a 1000 “histories”
for 1000 random variables, it would be close to impossible to not see a
95% correlation between two of them, and one that you know is entirely
spurious –something called the Wigner effect.)<br>
<br>
The problem is that even clinical trials fail to replicate about 25% of
the time; simply, the researchers do so many of them that one strange
result can show up by accident. It will be the one that is reported.
The good news is that the FDA is aware of the problem; it does not like
anything nonclinical.</div>

a disservice in using old words like 'truth' and 'fact' and 'theory'

Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective mechanism for
degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes, contributes to the
removal of altered proteins as part of the cellular quality-control
systems1, 2. We have previously found that CMA activity declines in
aged organisms and have proposed that this failure in cellular
clearance could contribute to the accumulation of altered proteins, the
abnormal cellular homeostasis and, eventually, the functional loss
characteristic of aged organisms. To determine whether these negative
features of aging can be prevented by maintaining efficient autophagic
activity until late in life, in this work we have corrected the CMA
defect in aged rodents. We have generated a double transgenic mouse
model in which the amount of the lysosomal receptor for CMA, previously
shown to decrease in abundance with age3, can be modulated. We have
analyzed in this model the consequences of preventing the age-dependent
decrease in receptor abundance in aged rodents at the cellular and
organ levels. We show here that CMA activity is maintained until
advanced ages if the decrease in the receptor abundance is prevented
and that preservation of autophagic activity is associated with lower
intracellular accumulation of damaged proteins, better ability to
handle protein damage and improved organ function.</div>

Readers might be surprised to learn that teeth appear in the fossil
record before bones. Shubin tells the story of how conodonts, the
plentiful fossil from ancient oceans, puzzled 19th century scientists
who debated whether they were animal, vegetable or mineral.<br>
<br>
One day a paleontologist discovered what looked like a lamprey fossil.
Inside the mouth of this primitive, jawless fish were rows of conodonts
- teeth! Those teeth, the earliest on record, had been observed 150
years before anyone realized what they were. It turns out that multiple
rows of teeth formed the building blocks of skulls, pushing back - eon
upon eon - to cover the brain.<br>
<br>
Those first bony-head skeletons, which belonged to a group of fish
called ostracoderms, looked "like hamburgers with fleshy tails," writes
Shubin. The fossilized skulls of these fish are shiny, like teeth or
fish scales. When this skull is studied under a microscope, "the whole
shield is made up of thousands of small teeth fused together."</div>

In the early days of monopoly money, bank lending officers were
conservative, and they tended to make loans to businesses. And
businesses create what are called self-liquidating loans: they borrow
money in order to make money. If they succeed in making money, they can
pay off the loan – it’s self-liquidating. What’s happened in the last
30 years is that bankers have preferred to lend to consumers and
speculators—consumers up until the ’90s began, and speculators ever
since. So they have been lending money to people so they could buy
cars, lately of course it was homes, and everything all the way down to
electronics like VCRs and DVDs players and things like that – people
are buying them on credit cards. In the past 4 years there has been a
very strong lending to hedge funds, so that they can leverage up even
more.<br>
<br>
If you look at that progression from businesses to consumers to
speculators you can see the loans are no longer self-liquidating. That
means somebody else has to go make money: that consumer has to make
money somewhere else to pay off the loan for the car, the loan itself
per se isn’t going into anything productive. And speculators of course
can lose all of that money in a flash. So the bankers are taking huge
risks, and you throw that on top of a burst real estate bubble where
the bankers have all of their money now, and I think the ingredients of
a credit collapse are right there to be had. But they will not
precipitate deflation until confidence finally turns down. And even
through the biggest drop in 40 years in the S&amp;P confidence never
flagged.</div>

{quote The chemical reactions that make up E. coli's metabolism don't
happen spontaneously, just as an egg does not boil itself. It takes
energy to join atoms together, as well as to break them apart. E. coli
gets its energy in two ways. One is by turning its membranes into a
battery. The other is by capturing the energy in its food.<br>
<br>
Among the channels that decorate E. coli's membranes are pumps that
hurl positively charged protons out of the microbe. E. coli gives
itself a negative charge in the process, attracting positively charged
atoms that happen to be in its neighborhood. It draws some of them into
special channels that can capture energy from their movement, like an
electric version of a waterwheel. E. coli stores that energy in the
atomic bonds of a molecule called ATP.<br>
<br>
ATP molecules float through E. coli like portable energy packs. When E.
coli's enzymes need extra energy to drive a reaction, they grab ATP and
draw out the energy stored in the bonds between its atoms. E. coli uses
the energy it gets from its membrane battery to get more energy from
its food. With the help of ATP, its enzymes can break down sugar,
cutting its bonds and storing the energy in still more ATP. It does not
unleast all the energy in a sugar molecule at once. If It did, most of
that energy would be lost in heat. Rather than burning up a bonfire of
sugar, E. coli makes surginal nicks, step by step, in order to release
manageable bursts of energy.<br>
<br>
E. coli uses some of this energy to build new molecules. Along with the
sugar it breaks down, it also needs a few minerals. But it has to work
hard to get even the trace amounts it requires. E. coli needs iron to
live, for example, but iron is exquisitely scarce. In a living host
most iron is tucked away inside cells. What little there is outside the
cells is usually bound up in other molecules, which will not surrender
it easily. E. coli has to fight for iron by building iron-stealing
molecules, called siderphores, and pumping them out into its
surroundings. As the siderophores drift along, they sometimes bump into
iron-bearing moleures. When they do, they pry away the iron atom and
then slide back into the E. coli. Once inside, the siderophores unfold
to release their treasure.<br>
<br>
While iron is essential to E. coli, it's also a poison. Once inside the
microbe, a free iron atom can seize oxygen atoms from water molecules,
turning them into hydrogen peroxide, which in turn will attack E.
coli's DNA. E. coli defends itself with proteins that scoop up iron as
soon as it arrives and store it away in deep pockets. A single one of
these proteins can safely hold 5,000 iron atoms, which it carefully
dispenses, one atom at a time, as the microbe needs them.<br>
<br>
Iron is not the only danger E. coli's metabolism posts to itself. Even
the proteins it builds can become poisonous. Acid, radiation, and other
sorts of damage can deform proteins, causing them to stop working as
they should. The mangled proteins wreak havoc, jamming the smooth
assemly line of chemistry E. coli depends on for survival. They can
even attack other proteins. E. coli protects itself from itself by
building a team of assassins---proteins whose sole function is to
destroy old proteins. Once an old protein has been minced into amino
acids, it becomes a supply of raw ingredients for new proteins. Life
and death, food and poison---all teeter together on a delicate fulcrum
inside E. coli.}</div>

From the inventor of fractal geometry, a revolutionary new theory that
overturns our understanding of how markets work. Benoit B. Mandelbrot,
one of the century's most influential mathematicians, is world-famous
for making mathematical sense of a fact everybody knows but that
geometers from Euclid on down had never assimilated: Clouds are not
round, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not smooth. To these
classic lines we can now add another example: Markets are not the safe
bet your broker may claim. In his first book for a general audience,
Mandelbrot, with co-author Richard L. Hudson, shows how the dominant
way of thinking about the behavior of markets--a set of mathematical
assumptions a century old and still learned by every MBA and financier
in the world--simply does not work. As he did for the physical world in
his classic The Fractal Geometry of Nature, Mandelbrot here uses
fractal geometry to propose a new, more accurate way of describing
market behavior. The complex gyrations of IBM's stock price and the
dollar-euro exchange rate can now be reduced to straightforward
formulae that yield a far better model of how risky they are. With his
fractal tools, Mandelbrot has gotten to the bottom of how financial
markets really work, and in doing so, he describes the volatile,
dangerous (and strangely beautiful) properties that financial experts
have never before accounted for. The result is no less than the
foundation for a new science of finance. </div>

Entwined environment–information transitions have characterized Earth's
evolutionary history since its beginning some 4 billion years ago (4
Gyr). Life emerged remarkably soon after surface conditions became
habitable, with the formation of oceans and cessation of sterilizing
asteroid impacts. The first organisms would have drained the
environment of energetically and structurally useful compounds and
replaced them with degraded waste products, including methane. An
ultimately dull fate for life, eking out a meagre existence on a
lifeboat Earth, was averted when closed recycling loops developed, in
which one life form's waste became another's food. These loops are
large-scale manifestations of the auto-catalytic nature of the cell,
locked in as the core of the global 'metabolism' that is still with us.<br>
<br>
Despite recycling, life remained energetically limited until the origin
of oxygenic photosynthesis, sometime before 2.7 Gyr. This breakthrough
in metabolic evolution greatly increased the free energy supply to the
biota, giving life a truly global environmental impact. It facilitated
the great oxidation of the atmosphere around 2.2 Gyr, but — as the long
time lag indicates — other factors were required. Perhaps oxidation had
to await tectonically driven changes in Earth's 'anatomy', including
the appearance of shelf seas where reduced organic carbon could reach
the sediments and be buried.<br>
<br>
Although the energetic stage was now set for global dominance by
eukaryotes, the emergence of a soft cell-boundary membrane coupled to
an internal skeleton and a means for cellular division were also
required. These transitions are thought to have been especially
difficult, as they required the fixation of thousands of rare mutations.<br>
<br>
Eukaryotes may be implicated in the worst crisis of past co-evolution:
the extreme Neoproterozoic glaciations of 0.8–0.6 Gyr that were
accompanied by a second rise in oxygen. Whenever eukaryotes started to
colonize the land surface, there would have been strong selection for
traits that accelerated weathering to access rock-bound nutrients.
Weathering of silicates would have inadvertently drawn down atmospheric
carbon dioxide and cooled the planet, and weathering of phosphorus
would have increased global productivity and contributed to oxygen
rise. The latter opened the door for the diversification of larger,
hard-shelled, animal life in the Cambrian explosion. After that, the
triumph of vascular land plants, causing a further rise in oxygen and
fall in carbon dioxide, played its part in creating the environmental
conditions in which active megafauna (including ourselves) evolved.</div>

In fact, a curious thing has happened in the past 2 years since Taleb
began to be famous. I increasingly hear people reference his
platonizations while betraying that they don’t actually understand what
he wrote. These are super-intelligent people who are good at using
appeals to authority to bolster rhetorical arguments, and well-meaning
people who simply want to know what the “system” of making wise choices
is. This was an obvious danger, since Taleb is writing about truths
that most people don’t really want to know. They want to think they
know, and they want to act like they know, but deep down they don’t
want to think all the way through to the logical conclusion. That’s why
mainstream economists have tended to ignore Mandelbrot, and no amount
of erudite exposition on the part of Taleb can combat human nature.<br>
<br>
This is why I recommend reading Mandelbrot and Popper first. If you
understand the implications of what they are saying, and really truly
want more, you’ll find more of it in Taleb. To my friends at Department
of Defense who were lapping up Mandelbrot in 1992, Taleb is like a
drink of fresh water. But if you don’t come to Taleb thirsty, you’ll at
best walk away with an arsenal of “clever turns of phrase” that you can
use to “dazzle and awe”, all the while lacking deep understanding.</div>

For many types of machine learning algorithms, one can compute the
statistically \optimal&amp;quot; way to select training data. In this
paper, we review how optimal data selection techniques have been used
with feedforward neural networks. We then show how the same principles
may be used to select data for two alternative, statistically-based
learning architectures: mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted
regression. While the techniques for neural networks are
computationally expensive and approximate, the techniques for mixtures
of Gaussians and locally weighted regression are both e cient and
accurate. Empirically, we observe that the optimality criterion sharply
decreases the number of training examples the learner needs in order to
achieve good performance. 1.</div>

Besides their expertise in mouse genetics, the authors brought two
major assets to their study: 1) they had already carefully mapped the
development of the short-tailed fruit bat (Carollia perspicillata, "our
model Chiropteran"); and 2) they knew a lot about the genetic control
of limb length in other mammals. In particular, they knew that the
protein Prx1 is known to influence limb elongation, by controlling the
expression of other genes. So they hypothesized that changes in the
activity or level of Prx1 might underlie the difference in limb length
between bats and mice, and they were well-equipped to do the
experiments.</div>

co-evolution between parasites and their hosts have been a prime
feature of all evolution, and that the parasites are the most dynamic

For five millennia, the city of Megiddo stood at one of the most
important junctions in the ancient Near East, the Nahal Iron Pass. This
pass was the only means of traversing the Carmel-Gilboa mountain range
on the road from Damascus to Egypt. By controlling this route, Megiddo
commanded the course of trade and the march of armies in the Holy Land.
Excavations suggest the city was repeatedly devastated by some large

As shown below (using methods that I've detailed frequently over the
years) there have been few instances outside of the 1973-74 collapse
and late 1990's bubble that 7-year total returns have departed by more
than a few percent from what valuations would have dictated. Indeed,
the only reason that total returns since 2000 have been positive at all
is because valuations are back to historically rich levels (though not
as extreme as in 2000). Even today, stocks are most probably priced to

Given that the steepest market plunges generally occur before a
recession is widely recognized, my impression is that investors should
at least be certain that they can tolerate the impact of a downturn
without substantially deviating from their investment discipline. As I
frequently note, there is nothing wrong with a long-term buy-and-hold
approach to stock market investing, provided investors recognize that
the impulse to abandon that strategy can be extremely strong when the
market has declined steeply and it seems that there is no end in sight.
If you examine the historical record, the norm for bear markets is a
loss of about 30%, with a typical frequency of one every 4-6 years.<br>
<br>
My intent here is not to encourage disciplined investors to deviate
from carefully considered investment plans. But if a recession or a
bear market would produce unacceptable losses or would force you to
abandon your investment plan, it is best to begin altering your
investment position immediately (even if not entirely at once) toward a
position that you can maintain regardless of market outcomes. If your
position is inappropriate, do not wait for an “ideal” opportunity to
change it. Begin changing it immediately, and continue to change it in
steps – larger steps when you can get favorable prices, smaller steps
when you have to do it at adverse prices. The important thing is to
start immediately and decide in advance to move step-by-step over a
reasonably limited period of time, until your position is appropriate.<br>
<br>
Anytime you discover you are taking too much risk, realize in advance
that you will experience some level of regret as you correct it – if
you sell your first portion and the market advances, you'll regret
having sold anything. If you sell your first portion and the market
continues to decline, you'll regret that you didn't sell everything.
The way to keep from being “paralyzed” in the financial markets is to
realize in advance that gradually changing an investment position will
always involve regret. It is better to “lock in” an acceptable level of
regret than to risk an unacceptable loss.</div>

Even if specific market outcomes can't be “timed” or “predicted” with
any consistency, it is enough that the average return/risk profile of
the market differs across various market conditions. This fact may not
appear helpful, since it doesn't help to accurately forecast individual
outcomes, and that's what people think they need. But consider it this
way. Knowing that a coin is slightly biased toward heads won't help
much in forecasting an individual throw either. Still, that sort of
knowledge can provide an enormous edge when you average the outcomes of
a large number of throws. </div>

As for the stock market, it's important to keep in mind that if you
look at the 6-month periods before and after the start of a recession,
you'll observe that the S&amp;P 500 has almost invariably dropped by
about 20% from the high within 6 months before a recession starts to
its low within 6 months after the recession starts. The eventual market
decline is often far worse, but it's very typical to observe a 20%
plunge within that 6-month band around a recession's start-date.<br>
<br>
Conversely, the strongest portion of a new bull market often occurs
while the economy is still in late-recession. Severe market declines
don't neatly overlap recessions - rather, they start before a recession
starts and end before a recession ends. For that reason, as Mark
Hulbert recently noted, if you measure only between the official start
and end dates of a recession, the market's performance is actually
fairly flat, on average. </div>

One of the key points I've made over the years is that recessions are
not periods of generally slumping demand. If you look at the pattern of
industry output during most recessions, the majority of industries are
relatively unscathed. Nominal consumer spending has, in fact, never
experienced a year-over-year decline in post-war data, and real
consumption is generally the most stable class of expenditures.<br>
<br>
No, the bulk of the damage in most recessions is confined to particular
industries that experience large mismatches between what is demanded
and what is supplied. The majority of weakness in GDP during a
recession is due to a slump not in consumption but in investment,
particularly inventory investment.<br>
<br>
In effect, recessions are periods when there is a mismatch between the
mix of goods supplied by the economy and the mix of goods demanded.
That mismatch causes a buildup of inventories in some industries, and
shortages in others. There is no such thing as a “representative
consumer” who just consumes less, as Keynes' simplistic modeling of the
economy would have people believe. The defining features of a recession
are dislocations and mismatches, not “general weakness in aggregate
demand.”<br>
<br>
What does that mean for us here? It means that if you want to look for
recession risk, staring at consumer confidence is the wrong activity.</div>

investment is really just another kind of spending to Keynes. Since
there is no production function in Keynesian theory, there's no reason
to invest anyway. It's not like the investment is what produces the
output, for gosh sakes, so the spending might as well be consumption. </div>

Recessions result when a mismatch develops between what is demanded
versus what is supplied. Economic downturns are not simply periods
where people reduce their consumption of some “representative good.”
Rather, we see most industries virtually unaffected by recessions, with
a few industries actually experiencing shortages, but with a handful of
industries experiencing devastating drop-offs in demand.</div>

The Zimmern book is a more technical book than the Kitto book reviewed
earlier on this blog. See what you can of the book here. See something
about Zimmern here. As I wrote in the Kitto review, this book was
recommended by VDH to me as two great books on the Greeks. I could not
agree more.<br>
<br>
The book is more technical because it delves into the economic
development of Greece. It is very detailed in this respect. There is
less an emphasis on the politics of Greece (and Athens) than there is
in the Kitto book. There is more emphasis on necessity and growth of
Attica. Like Kitto, there is not much on the Peloponnesian War. </div>

At all stages try to see THROUGH the text to the documents on which it
is based. Ideally you should try to DEMOLISH the book, break it down
into its constituent parts. Obviously, at your stage, you cannot carry
this process very far. But try to THINK in this way. The hardest job of
all for a normal student at your stage is to break out of the prison of

PHILLIP LASKER: Some analysts say the major difference here is that
there's no stock. We don't have the supply of homes here in Australia
like in the United States so we're in the going to see that crash in
property prices that we saw in the United States.<br>
<br>
STEVE KEEN: That's the old supply and demand argument, the favourite
harbinger of every economist except me. To me where the demand comes
from is people's willingness to borrow money to buy an asset. And that
reflects their expectation that the price of the asset rising.<br>
<br>
I think something of the orders of 40 per cent of prices are simply
financed by people's expectations that the prices will keep on rising.
Well when this expectation goes, ultimately goodbye 40 per cent of the
current price of houses.</div>

<div class="editbox">
Mathematically, the total return on stocks over any future time horizon
can be estimated using the following equation. Annualized future total
return =<br>
<br>
(1 g)(Original Yield/Terminal Yield)1/N - 1   (Original   Terminal)/2<br>
<br>
Where Original Yield is the original dividend yield (in decimal form),
Terminal Yield is the dividend yield expected at the end of the holding
period, N is the holding period in years, and g is the growth rate of
dividends over the holding period. For example, at the 1982 bear market
low, the dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 Index reached a rich 6.7%.
Over the following 16 years, the dividend yield has declined to just
1.4%, while dividends have grown at an average annual rate of 5.4%.
Over those 16 years, the total return on the S&amp;P 500 has been
breathtakingly high, at over 20% annualized. Why? Do the math.
Annualized total return =<br>
<br>
(1.054)(.067/.014)1/16 - 1   (.067   .014)/2 = .203 = 20.3% annually<br>
<br>
Note the rule: You want to own stocks when the yield on stocks is high,
or while favorable market action (interest rates, inflation, market
breadth) are uniformly driving the yield downward. Beware when neither
is true.<br>
<br>
Currently, assuming dividend growth speeds up to a 6% rate and that the
dividend yield is still just 1.4% in the future, the long term total
return on stocks will be 7.4%. But here's a more likely result: suppose
the future dividend yield rises even a bit, even to just 2%. If that
happens over the next 5 years, investors will earn a total return of
zero over those 5 years. Over the next 10 years: just 4% annually. Over
the next 20 years: 5.8% annually. Over the next 30 years: 6.4%
annually. If the dividend yield rises to the historical average of 4%
even 30 years from now, investors will have earned a total return of
just 5% annually over that span. Consider that figure long and hard
before trusting your retirement plans to a buy-and-hold approach in
stocks.</div>

Notice also that given any future stream of dividend, interest or face
value payments, the higher the price you pay now, the lower the annual
rate of return you will earn over the long run. In other words, when
the future long-term return on a security falls, the current price
rises.</div>

inaugural years following a Democratic win in November are better than
Republican inaugural years. There is a reason for this pattern. The
market expects the worst of a Democratic President and then discovers
that he's not so bad for investors. It tends to rebound after the
initial premonitions that a Democrat will win. On the other hand, Wall
Street expects the most of a Republican and is disillusioned after the

If you examine the track history of cures since the civil war in the
US, you’ll find that the greatest number of true cures have come from
military research. I’m not speaking of treatments or therapies - I’m
speaking of cures. The reason for this in my opinion is that the
resources of the military are quite large, and the mission of the
military (winning and keeping veteran care costs as low as possible) is
quite different from commercial concerns whose key concern is to have a
product requiring chronic dosing that creates trackable earnings for
wall st and their investors. So, in short, the incentives currently in
the system do not produce cures. It’s literally too expensive for a
company to cure anything. The pill to cover the cost of research,
development and marketing would have to cost 6 figures each if you only
needed to take one - ever.<br>

So, that’s why I love the prize model.</div>

Market tops are created because investors stop looking for a top, and
simply extrapolate good news as a permanent feature of the economic
landscape. Similarly, market bottoms are created because investors stop
looking for a bottom, and extrapolate ongoing bad news. If you remember
the lows of 1982, or 1990-1991, or 2002, you'll recall that in each
instance, the question among investors wasn't whether the economy would
recover in one quarter versus two quarters. The question was how the
economy could recover at any point in the foreseeable future. Investors
give up hope at bottoms. We don't see that here. </div>

<br>
This has not changed much throughout recorded history. It is widey
believed that scientific discoveries turn much faster in our day than
ever before into technology, products, and processes. But this is
largely illusion. Around 1250 the Englishman Roger Bacon, a Franciscan
monk, showed that refraction defects of the eye could be corrected with
eyeglasses. This was incompatible with what everybody then know: the
"infallible" authority of the Middle Ages Galen, the great medical
scientist, had "proven conclusively" that it could not be done. Roger
Bacon lived and worked on the extreme edges of the civilized world, in
the wilds of northern Yorkshire. Yet a mural, painted thirty years
later in the Palace of the Popes in Avignon ([in France,] where it can
still be seen), shows elderly cardinals wearing reading glasses; and
ten years later, miniatures show elderly courtiers in the Sultan's
Palace in Cairo also in glasses. <br>
<br>
The mill race, which was the first true "automation," was developed to
grind grain by the Benedictine monks in northern Europe around the year
1000; within thirty years it had spread all over Europe. Gutenberg's
invention of movable type and the woodcut both followed within thirty
years of the West's learning of Chinese printing.}</div>

<div class="editbox"> The Reagan tax cuts, like similar measures
enacted in the 1920s and 1960s, showed that reducing excessive tax
rates stimulates growth, reduces tax avoidance, and can increase the
amount and share of tax payments generated by the rich. High top tax
rates can induce counterproductive behavior and suppress revenues,
factors that are usually missed or understated in government static
revenue analysis. Furthermore, the key assumption of static revenue
analysis that economic growth is not affected by tax changes is di
sproved by the experience of previous tax reduction programs. There is
little reason to expect static revenue analysis to evaluate the
economic or distributional effects of current tax reform proposals much
better than it evaluated the Reagan tax program 15 years ago. </div>

As I was reading the book via PDF on the flight yesterday, I got another idea for a derivative work:<br>
<br>
Take a book and annotate it with contrary evidence and arguments and questions.<br>
<br>
Call it the fisking edition.<br>
<br>
Mind you, I'm not saying that because I'm going after Lessig or have
any intention of doing that edition -- he's too damned smart and too
good at arguing his ideas and, as I've said before, I'm too smart to
find myself on the losing end of a debate with him even if I do
disagree with him. Fisking is just an easy way to describe what I mean.<br>
<br>
Or maybe I should call it the Talmudic editions.<br>
<br>
I'd love to see someone who does know what he or she is talking about
dive into the book and give me either more facts to help me make up my
mind or more facts to help me make my arguments. I'd love to hear two
sides.<br>
<br>
I'd love to see Tim Blair create the annotated edition of any Michael
Moore book. Or Matthew Yglesias create a civilized response to the
rantings of Ann Coulter. Those would be pure entertainment. I wouldn't
mind taking on the blatherings of Republic.com. What books would you
take on?<br>
<br>
And once we take on these books, the authors can create their next
derivative works, replying. And, I know, I'm creating a ringing
endorsement of Creative Commons with this. But wouldn't it be great to
take a book and break it open at the spine for some back-and-forth?<br>

What was De Vany's secret? For nearly two decades, he'd been eating and
exercising as humans did in Paleolithic times – the early Stone Age.
He'd come across research suggesting that we should be eating like our
hunter-gatherer forebears – lean meat, fish, vegetables, nuts, but no
grains, beans or dairy. It had made sense, so he took it up.<br>
<br>
As De Vany points out, the fossil record reveals that our cave
ancestors were not only slim, lean, fit and healthy, but that they did
not generally suffer from many of the diseases that plague us today,
such as cancer, allergies and heart disease. What's more, as long as
they weren't gored by a wild beast or struck down by infection, they
lived as long as we do today. They stayed agile and vigorous until they
dropped (no wheelchairs and care homes for them).</div>

The more profound explanation is that the pen was prepared into an unstable position.<br>

Similarly for the stock market, you have two classes or two levels of
explanations. When you witness a crash, most of the time people invoke
some news--some recent news--like a new tax law or interest rate
increase. Something like that that just occurred a day before or a week

Interesting, because Alan Greenspan was defending himself in the
financial press the other day — and has done many times before — saying
that it’s not possible to identify when markets are in bubbles. It’s a
view that the prediction industry likes to repeat. But my understanding
of Sornette’s science is that this is just not correct; you can
identify bubble conditions from within trading price data using the
same approach a seismologist does to gauge the susceptibility of the
fault lines between tectonic plates to a sudden shift. I think the
mathematical model he applied to the housing markets goes by the name
of “log-periodic oscillations”. Predicting when the quake will occur,
and with what magnitude, is the problem. That is still a work in
progress, but one guesses that Sornette will be at the forefront of it
as it unfolds.</div>

De Vany’s concept of evolutionary fitness argues for the reduction or
removal of grains from the diet, because they are essentially
agricultural products and would not have featured much on a
hunter-gatherer’s menu. So when the waiter offered us onion bhaji as a

It is a trend of thought that affirms the power of human beings to
create, improve, and reshape their environment, with the aid of
scientific knowledge, technology or practical experimentation.[1]
Modernism encouraged the re-examination of every aspect of existence,
from commerce to philosophy, with the goal of finding that which was
'holding back' progress, and replacing it with new, progressive and
therefore better, ways of reaching the same end.<br>
<br>
Embracing change and the present, modernism encompasses the works of
thinkers who rebelled against nineteenth century academic and
historicist traditions, believing the "traditional" forms of art,
architecture, literature, religious faith, social organization and
daily life were becoming outdated; they directly confronted the new
economic, social and political conditions of an emerging fully

With regard to the “yen carry trade,” want to know who is the largest
investor in that trade? Simple: the nation of Japan. It is the Japanese
themselves who are most active in selling yen, buying dollars, and
investing in U.S. Treasuries at higher yields. Japan has done this, as
China has with its currency, in order to support the value of the U.S.
dollar. But as their ownership of Treasury securities has grown, the
potential cost of any realignment of exchange rates is becoming
dangerously high, so both countries are beginning to diversify their
central bank assets into other currencies such as the euro.
Accumulating U.S. securities may have been fun while it lasted, but
China and Japan are beginning to realize that the U.S. government has
no plans to restrain its fiscal irresponsibility (largely because it
lacks the capacity for constructive diplomacy).</div>

In earlier times, when goose quill and ink were used on parchment, it
was tedious and difficult to correct what had been written. Writers had
to be careful. Sentences had to be thought through before being set to
paper. One result was sentences that were long and embellished---the
graceful rhetorical style we associate with older literature. With the
advent of easier to use writing tools, corrections became easier to
make; so writing was done more rapidly, but also with less thought and
care---more like everyday speech. Some critics decried the lack of
literary niceties. Others argued that this was how people really
communicated, and besides, it was easier to understand.</div>

The fact is that this invention will produce forgetfulness in the souls
of those who have learned it. They will not need to exercise their
memories, being able to rely on what is written, calling things to mind
no longer from within themselves by their own unaided powers, but under
the stimulus of external marks that are alien to themselves. So it's
not a recipe for memory, but for reminding, that you have discovered.
And as for wisdom, you're equipping your pupils with only a semblance
of it, not with truth. Thanks to you and your invention, your pupils
will be widely read without benefit of a teacher's instruction; in
consequence, they'll entertain the delusion that they have wide
knowledge, while they are, in fact, for the most part incapable of real
judgment. They will also be difficult to get on with since they will

If we consider the long-term process described above in terms of the
Kübler-Ross model of the five stages of grief, then we are probably
transitioning from the Bargaining stage to the Depression stage:<br>
<br>
1. Denial: "This can't be happening."<br>
<br>
2. Anger: "Why me?!"<br>
<br>
3. Bargaining: "Just let me get back to even.", "Can't we stretch it out a few more years?"<br>
<br>
4. Depression: "What's the point?"<br>
<br>
5. Acceptance: "It's going to be OK."<br>
<br>
Of course, considering that even now people are standing in line for
Apple (AAPL) iPhones even as the U.S. government is discussing the
nationalization of Fannie and Freddie, a move that will further depress
the housing market as mortgages and credit become even less available,
perhaps many of us remain firmly attached to the denial stage. </div>

When you call a generator function, it doesn’t return a single value;
instead it returns a generator object that supports the iterator
protocol. On executing the yield expression, the generator outputs the
value of i, similar to a return statement. The big difference between
yield and a return statement is that on reaching a yield the
generator’s state of execution is suspended and local variables are
preserved. On the next call to the generator’s .next() method, the
function will resume executing.</div>

Functional programming can be considered the opposite of
object-oriented programming. Objects are little capsules containing
some internal state along with a collection of method calls that let
you modify this state, and programs consist of making the right set of
state changes. Functional programming wants to avoid state changes as
much as possible and works with data flowing between functions.</div>

So emerging panic is not enough – there has to be some basis to believe
that a positive shift in investor attitudes toward risk would be
sustainable. Again, falling interest rates, moderate valuations, and
very strong market action early into the rebound are useful in

Over the years, I've noted that bear markets typically involve far
greater volatility and far larger short-term advances than investors
typically remember in hindsight. The 2000-2002 bear, for example,

Still, we should not assume that the next significant capitulation will
be the last. Bear markets typically involve a series of them (e.g.
initial weakness on no news or only fears about interest rates or
inflation, initial earnings disappointments, initial evidence of
economic weakness, consensus about recession itself, consensus about
the deepening of the recession, and eventually the mother of all bear
market lows – complete loss of hope and a panic to cut deepening losses

The simplest part is the insight that the total return of a stock is
equal to the current dividend yield dividend growth rate. Thus a stock
currently yields 4% and has been growing dividends at 6% in the past
and is likely to do so in the future its long term total return is 6%
4%=10%. Johnson and Johnson is a classic example with a yield which has
been around 2% for most of the last 30 years, but with a dividend
growth rate of 14%. The total return on JNJ including reinvesting
dividends has been 16% over a 30 year period.</div>

Learn to love high quality food and variety. Eat fresh vegetables and
fruits as your mainstay. Cook by color and texture, always with an eye
to bright colors and a variety of them. Red and green are good. Brown,
as in toast, french fries, or cereal, is bad.<br>
<br>
Skip dinner now and then and just go hungry until the next morning.
Then enjoy a good breakfast. Egg whites and melon are a great
breakfast. Smoked salmon and a bit of fresh fruit is a winning meal
anytime, but especially for breakfast.<br>
<br>
Work out briefly, but with some intensity, 2 or 3 times a week. Hike,
walk, and play a lot. I will post a beginning work out soon, but it is
not rocket science. Work the big muscles a bit hard, work on balance,
core stability and balance, then get out of the gym and walk outside.<br>
<br>
Do not fear fat, but cut the bad fats. A good deal of the metabolic
syndrome (which virtually all persons with abdominal obesity have) is
from the toxicity of excess fat in the blood stream (the beta cells of
the pancreas suffer from lipid toxicity). Some of it comes from the
abdominal fat itself. But, some of it comes from saturated fat and
transfat in the diet.<br>
<br>
Eat lean meats, in moderate amounts. Easy on the sauces. Learn to love
crab and mussels and lobster. Chicken on skewers loaded with red bell
peppers and onion done on the grill is something you should have once a
week. Grill vegetables when you are tired of steaming them. Or, sauté
them in olive oil and garlic.<br>
<br>
Of course, cut the manufactured foods in all forms. You will save money, even though you are eating lobster now and then.<br>
<br>
No juices, protein drinks, or diet sodas. You have outgrown your need
for milk. Make sure you get next to no fructose (easy to do if you
avoid manufactured "foods").<br>
<br>
Take some kind of nutritional supplements that provide ample antioxidants and B complex vitamins</div>

3 It’s not a good idea to take a forecast from someone wearing a tie.
If possible, tease people who take themselves and their knowledge too

4 Wear your best for your execution and stand dignified. Your last
recourse against randomness is how you act — if you can’t control
outcomes, you can control the elegance of your behaviour. You will
always have the last word.<br>

5 Don’t disturb complicated systems that have been around for a very
long time. We don’t understand their logic. Don’t pollute the planet.
Leave it the way we found it, regardless of scientific ‘evidence’.<br>

6 Learn to fail with pride — and do so fast and cleanly. Maximise trial and error — by mastering the error part.<br>
<br>
7 Avoid losers. If you hear someone use the words ‘impossible’,
‘never’, ‘too difficult’ too often, drop him or her from your social
network. Never take ‘no’ for an answer (conversely, take most ‘yeses’
as ‘most probably’).<br>
<br>
8 Don’t read newspapers for the news (just for the gossip and, of
course, profiles of authors). The best filter to know if the news
matters is if you hear it in cafes, restaurants... or (again) parties.<br>

And you and me? Well, the good investment strategy is to put 90% of
your money in the safest possible government securities and the
remaining 10% in a large number of high-risk ventures. This insulates
you from bad black swans and exposes you to the possibility of good
ones. Your smallest investment could go “convex” – explode – and make

This has been profoundly wrong for at least two centuries. ... <br>

As noted in earlier chapters, the efficient uses of scarce resources by
the economy as a whole depends on a system that features both profits
and losses. Businesses are interested only in the profit half. If they
can avoid losses by getting government subsidies, tariffs and other
restrictions against imports, or domestic laws that stifle competition
in various agricultural products, they will do so. Losses, however, are
essential to the process that shifts resources to those who are
providing what consumers want at the lowest prices-and away from those

{quote It has been estimated that the gain in domestic American steel
production due to import restrictions led to a net loss in the
production of domestic American steel products as a whole. In other
words, American industry as a whole was worse off, on net balance, as a
result of the import restrictions on steel.<br>
<br>
Nor were workers any better off after import restrictions were imposed
in order to "save jobs." When new restrictions were placed on steel
imports in 2002, the Wall Street Journal estimated that "Illinois would
lose five jobs for every one protected, Ohio three for every one and
Pennsylvania and Indiana, two for every one." In short, states in which
the production of steel and steel products is concentrated stood to
lose jobs, on net balance, as a result of policies designed to save
jobs by putting restrictions on the importation of foreign steel. A
later study confirmed a net loss of American jobs from steel tariffs.}<br>

devoted to political activities and the mastering of legal

{quote The time when "a strong back and a weak mind" were sufficient for many jobs is long past in most modern economies.}<br>
<br>
{quote In 1951, most Americans reached their peak earnings between 35
and 44 years of age, and people in those age brackets earned about half
again as much as workers in their early twenties. By 1973, people in
the 35 to 44-year-old brackets earned more than double the income of
the younger workers. Twenty years later, the peak earnings bracket had
moved up to 45 to 54 years of age, and people in those brackets earned
more than three times what workers in their early twenties earned.}<br>
<br>
I'm a little unclear on if "twenty years later" means that the 45-54
group had achieved primacy in 1973 or 1993, but the point stands and is
fascinating. Pay(35-44, 1951)=0.5*Pay(20s, 1951). Pay(35-44,
1973)=2*Pay(20s, 1973). Pay(45-54, 1973 or 1993)=3*Pay(20s, 1973 or
1993). Despite the internet revolution, this trend is likely to be in
place today, although for different reasons (grad school, student
loans, etc.)<br>
<br>
{quote Women, for example, have long had lower incomes than men, but
most women give birth to children at some point in their lives and many
stay out of the labor force until their children reach an age where
they can be put into some form of day care while their mothers go to
work. These interruptions of their careers cost women workplace
experience and seniority, which in turn inhibit the rise of their
incomes over the years relative to that of men who have been working
continuously in the meantime. However, as far back as 1971, women who
worked continuously from high school through their thirties earned
slightly more than men of the same description, even though women as a
group earned substantially less than men as a group.} <br>

{quote Although people in the top income brackets and the bottom income
brackets---"the rich" and "the poor," as they are often called---may be
discussed as if they were different classes of people, often they are
the very same people at different stages of their lives. An absolute
majority of those Americans who were in the bottom 20 percent in income
in 1975 were also in the top 20 percent at some point over the next 16
years. This is not surprising.}<br>
<br>
{quote When some people are born, live, and die in poverty, while
others are born, live, and die in luxury, that is a very different
situation from one in which young people have not yet reached the
income level of older people, such as their parents. But the kind of
statistics often cited in the media, and even in academia, typically do
not distinguish these very different situations. Moreover, those who
publicize such statistics usually proceed as if they are talking about
differences between classes rather than differences between age
brackets. Because of the movement of people from one income bracket to
another over the years, the degree of income inequality over a lifetime
is not the same as the degree of income inequality in any given year.}<br>
<br>
{quote a detailed analysis of U.S. Census data showed that there were
39 million people in the bottom 20 percent of households but 64 million
people in the top 20 percent of households ... there is nothing equal
about those layers. They represent grossly different numbers of people}<br>
<br>
{quote The sizes of families and households have differed not only from
one income bracket to another at a given time, but also have differed
over time. These differences are not incidental. They radically change
the implications of "income distribution" statistics. For example, real
income per American household rose only 6 percent over the entire
period from 1969 to 1996, but real per capita income rose 51 percent
over the same period. The discrepancy is due to the fact that the
average size of families and households was declining during these
years, so that smaller households were now earning about the same as
larger households had earned a generation earlier. ... A Washington
Post writer, for example, declared that "the incomes of most American
households have remained stubbornly flat over the past three decades."
It might be more accurate to say that some writers have remained
stubbornly blind to economic facts. When two people in one household
today earn the same total amount of money that three people were
earning in one household in the past, that is a 50 percent increase in
income per person---even when household income remains the same.}<br>
<br>
{quote Describing people in certain income brackets as "rich" is false
for a more fundamental reason: Income and wealth are different things.
No matter how much income passes through your hands in a given year,
your wealth depends on how much you have accumulated over the years.
... [Therefore] despite some confused or misleading discussions of "the
rich" and "the poor," based on people's transient positions in the
income streams, genuinely rich and genuinely poor people exist---people
who are going to be living in luxury or in poverty all their
lives---but they are much rarer than gross income statistics would
suggest. Just as most American "poor" do not stay poor, so most rich
Americans were not born rich.} Recall that we must remember that income
is different than wealth.<br>
<br>
And just in case you missed it: {quote When an absolute majority of
those in the bottom 20 percent in income in 1975 were also in the top
20 percent at some point by 1991, you cannot determine the degree of
income inequality between people by looking at inequality between
income brackets at a given time.}</div>

{quote The term "productivity" is sometimes used loosely to describe an
employee's contribution to a company's earnings. The problem is that
this word is also defined in other ways and sometimes the implication
is left that each worker has a certain productivity that is inherent in
that worker, rather than being dependent on surrounding circumstances
as well. A worker using the latest modern equipment can produce more
output than the very same worker employed in another firm whose
equipment is not quite as up-to-date or whose management does not have
things organized as well. For example, Japanese-owned cotton mills in
China during the 1930s paid higher wages than Chinese-owned cotton
mills there, but the Japanese-run mills had lower labor costs per unit
of output because they had higher output per worker. This was not due
to different equipment---they both used the same machines---but to more
efficient management brought over from Japan.}<br>
<br>
Note this: the Japanese firms had lower labor costs per unit while
paying higher wages! No arguments about economies of scale can be

In previous decades-from the 1920s into the 1950s-White Castle was the
dominant hamburger chain in the United States. People walked to White
Castle hamburger restaurants, which meant that these restaurants had to
be located in places with high population densities, so as to generate
a large volume of pedestrian traffic coming in, enabling White Castle
to sell to many people who came from a limited distance. Accordingly,
White Castles were , often located near factories or in crowded working
class neighborhoods in central cities. And they stayed open around the
clock.<br>
<br>
Financing was also very different in that earlier era. Unlike later
fast-food chains, White Castle did not have franchises. The parent
company owned each restaurant and built new ones only when it had the
money on hand to pay cash to do so. This enabled White Castle to ride
out the Great Depression of the 1930s, when many other businesses,
homes, and farms were lost because mortgages could not be paid at a
time when money was so scarce.<br>
<br>
Indeed, White Castle expanded during the Depression. It was almost
ideally adapted to the world in which it existed. But it lost its
unchallenged leadership of the industry and began a decline into
obscurity when the economy and society changed around its restaurants
in the middle of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>
As middle-class and even working class people became more prosperous,
acquired automobiles, and moved out of the central cities into the
suburbs, reducing population densities in the cities, White Castle
could no longer count on the heavy urban pedestrian traffic on which it
had thrived. Its conservative financing policies meant that it could
not expand as rapidly into the suburbs as other businesses which went
into debt to do so, or raised capital by requiring their franchisees to
put up part of the money needed. The rising crime and violence of the
central cities in the 1960s were more of a problem for White Castle
than for other hamburger chains located in suburban shopping malls.
Staying open all night in low-income urban neighborhoods was no longer
safe, financially or otherwise.</div>

[entry] Because economics is a study of cause and effect among human
beings, it deals with incentives and their consequences. That often
leads to radically different conclusions from those reached by people
who think primarily or solely in terms of goals.<br>
<br>
[entry] While scarcity is inherent, shortages are not. Scarcity simply
means that there is not enough to satisfy everyone's desires
completely. Only in the Garden of Eden was there enough to do that. A
shortage, however, means that there are people who are Willing to pay
the price of the product but are unable to find it.<br>
<br>
[entry] People are dumber in mobs because they feel that they can do
something about what grieves them and don't have to reason carefully
about what that is.<br>
<br>
[entry] One of the incidental benefits of competing and sharing through
prices is that different people are not as likely to think of
themselves as rivals, nor to develop the kinds of hostility that
rivalry can breed. For example, much the same labor and construction
material needed to build a Protestant church could be used to build a
Catholic church. But, if a Protestant congregation is raising money to
build a church for themselves, they are likely to be preoccupied with
how much money they can raise and how much is needed for the kind of
church they want. Construction prices may cause them to scale back some
of their more elaborate plans, in order to fit within the limits of
what they can afford. But they are unlikely to blame Catholics, even
though the competition of Catholics for the same construction materials
makes their prices higher than otherwise.<br>
<br>
If, instead, the government were in the business of building churches
and presenting them to different religious groups, Protestants and
Catholics would be explicit rivals for this largesse and neither would
have any financial incentive to cut back on their building plans to
accommodate the other. Instead, each would have an incentive to make
the case, as strongly as possible, for the full extent of their desires
and to resent any suggestion that they scale back their plans. The
inherent scarcity of materials and labor would still limit what could
be built, but that limit would now be imposed politically and would be
seen by each as due to the rivalry of the other. The Constitution of
the United States of course prevents the American government from
building churches for religious groups, no doubt in order to prevent
just such political rivalries and the bitterness, and sometimes
bloodshed, to which such rivalries have led in other countries.<br>
<br>
The same economic principle, however, applies to groups that are not
based on religion but on ethnicity, geographical regions, or age
brackets. All are inherently competing for the same resources, simply
because these resources are scarce. However, competing indirectly by
having to keep your demands within the limits of your Own pocketbook is
very different from seeing your desires for government benefits
thwarted by the rival claims of some other group. Market rationing
limits the amount of your claims on the output of others to what your
own productivity has created, while political rationing limits your
claims by the competing claims and clout of others.</div>

ALGEBRA<br>
<br>
This research group investigates the following subjects:<br>
(1) Number Theory : algebraic number theory, modular forms, p-adic cohomology and arithmetic geometry.<br>
(2) Representation Theory : representations of algebraic groups, Lie
algebras, quantum groups, algebraic analysis and mathematical physics.<br>
(3) Algebraic Geometry : vector bunbles, Chow groups, motives of
algebraic varieties, Calabi-Yau manifolds, open algebraic varieties and
theory of singular points.<br>
(4) Ring Theory : differential forms of rings.<br>
(Staff 8, Doctor 2, Master 10)<br>
<br>
GEOMETRY and TOPOLOGY<br>
<br>
Topology is a discipline of mathematics which considers new purposes
and new ways of thinking as important. Geometry is deeply related to
physics and promotes progress in mathematics. Research subjects of the
geometry group are the differential geometry and representation theory
in the context of the Lie groups and differential manifolds. The
subjects of the topology group are algebraic topology and topology of
manifolds, in particular the theory of 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds,
singularities, foliations, knots, and characteristic classes. Geometry
related to infinite analysis as well as themes from quasi-crystals,
information geometry and computational geometry are also studied.<br>
(Staff 8, Doctor 4, Master 10)<br>
<br>
MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS<br>
<br>
Many phenomena arising in natural science may be described analytically
as partial differential equations. The group on mathematical analysis
is devoted to analyzing partial differential equations and providing
powerfull mathematical methods for future research in science and
technology.<br>
In the theoretical approach, qualitative properties of solutions to
partial differential equations, such as existence, uniqueness,
regularity and asymptotic behavior of solutions are studied. In the
numerical approach, fluid dynamics and reaction-diffusion problems are
studied by making good use of computers, for example, mathematical
modeling and implementations of phenomena by computer simulation.
Several recent developments in the theory of partial differential
equations have made possible further progress in computer science.<br>
(Staff 7, Doctor 0, Master 12)<br>
<br>
PROBABILITY THEORY and MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS<br>
<br>
The purpose of research in this field is to analyze random phenomena in
nature and society. The probability theory group studies stochastic
processes, stochastic analysis, ergodic theory, theory of chaos and
fractals, and the probabilistic approach to mathematical physics.<br>
The mathematical statistics group studies multivariate analysis,
statistical inference, model selection design of experiments,
asymptotic statistical theory, nonparametric methods, computational
methods, data analysis and other topics.<br>
(Staff 6, Doctor 4, Master 12)<br>
<br>
GEOMETRIC and ALGEBRAIC ANALYSIS<br>
<br>
This research group consists of following subjects:<br>
(1) Geometry : Theory of Lie Groups and Homogeneous Spaces,
Differential Geometry, Differential Topology, Algebraic Topology,
Complex Geometry.<br>
(2) Algebra : Representation Theory of Infinite dimensional Lie
Algebras and Quantum Groups, Algebraic Geometry, Mathematical Phisics,
Homological Algebra.<br>

number theory developed 50-100 years ago, and at that time they were
not considered to be useful to the science. These days, pure abstract
mathematics are considered to be redundant even in universities, and
mathematics departments tend to be closed or changed into informatics.
We don't think this is a right way. Pure mathematics shows "unexpected
unreasonable effectiveness" in many areas of the science, although its
effectiveness is not so easily percepted by the society, compared to
other branches of science. We are glad if you take it into
consideration that the present society is supported by mathematics
developped hundreds years ago, and the next generation might be
supported by the modern mathematics which might seem to be too abstract
to utilize in the society, just right now.</div>

MT was firstly named "Primitive Twisted Generalized Feedback Shift
Register Sequence" by a historical reason. Makoto: Prof. Knuth said in
his letter "the name is mouthful."<br>
Takuji:........<br>

a few days later<br>
Makoto:Hi, Takkun, How about "Mersenne Twister?" Since it uses Mersenne
primes, and it shows that it has its ancestor Twisted GFSR.<br>
Takuji:Well.<br>
Makoto:It sounds like a jet coaster, so it sounds quite fast, easy to
remember and easy to pronounce. Moreover, although it is a secret, it
hides in its name the initials of the inventors.<br>

Where do you get your genes? If you are an animal, you inherit them
from your parents at the moment of conception, and that's about it. No
later incorporation of environmental DNA for you, unless you become
host to a parasite or an endosymbiont that somehow transfers bits of
its genome into yours (which is a rarely documented event).<br>
<br>
Unless you are a bdelloid rotifer, that is.<br>
<br>
This odd, microscopic, freshwater animal is making news once again,
this time for the startling discovery of numerous chunks of foreign DNA
in its genome. In a paper published this week in Science, evidence for
massive horizontal gene transfer—from bacteria, fungi, even from
plants—into the bdelloid rotifer genome is presented by Irina Arkhipova
and Matthew Meselson, scientists at the MBL's Josephine Bay Paul Center
and at Harvard University, and Harvard graduate student Eugene
Gladyshev.<br>
<br>
While horizontal gene transfer is common in bacterial species, it was
unheard of in the animal kingdom on such a massive scale – until this
study.</div>

Note that this also explains why supercomputers died in the 90’s, but
big iron database servers didn’t. Supercomputers were, at heart, about
solving either large numbers of small linear algebra problems, or a
small number of large linear algebra problems. In either case, the
problems were fairly easily distributed with small communication
demands- a few megabytes per second- that supercomputers could be
replaced by racks of PCs communicating via ethernet. Databases,
however, require more communication between nodes (especially if you
want to parallelize a single query, or allow multiple queries to access
the same table simultaneously), and as such didn’t distribute via
ethernet. So Sun and IBM are still profitable, Cray and SGI are dead.</div>

Reverse transcriptase makes trouble in other ways as well. The genomes
of most organisms are littered with entities known as retroelements.
These are a type of genetic parasite — stretches of DNA that (usually)
do nothing useful for the cell, and exist simply to make more copies of
themselves. (There are many different kinds of genetic parasite: as
much as half of the DNA in the human genome is thought to have
originated from them.) The way that retroelements proliferate is
complicated, and depends on the element in question, for there are many
sorts; but one thing they all have in common is that they, too, depend
on the activity of reverse transcriptase.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, by accident, reverse transcriptase goes to work on a regular
piece of messenger RNA, and copies that into DNA. This new piece of DNA
may then be incorporated into the genome, giving rise to a new gene — a
retrogene.<br>
<br>
What’s interesting about this is that the original gene — the one from
which the messenger RNA was generated — will still be present in the
genome. In other words, the retrogene is a copy of a gene that already
exists. However, the retrogene need not end up anywhere near its
original. A retrogene may, for example, be inserted into a different
chromosome from its “parent.”<br>
<br>
It also need not have the same activities as its parent. Because a
retrogene is made from messenger RNA, it lacks a control region — the
part of the gene that acts as a switch, and determines whether the gene
is “on” (and the protein is being made) or “off.” So in order for a
retrogene to be functional and actually make proteins, it has to be
inserted into the genome in such a way that it can capture the control
region of another gene.<br>
<br>
As a consequence, whether a newly created retrogene will appear and
immediately vanish — or whether it will confer some kind of advantage
on the organism and thus spread through the population — depends on
where in the genome it gets inserted. If it arrives in the “wrong”
place, it may not be able to be switched on; or worse, it may destroy
the workings of an existing gene and harm the organism in some way.
Hence, only a fraction of the retrogenes that are created will succeed
in becoming established.</div>

Intelligence, and consciousness, could be seen as simply the result of having a neocortex.<br>
<br>
We sometimes wonder about machines resenting their enslavement and
taking over the world because people always resent enslavement or have
tried to take over the world. But these come from non-cortical drives,
specifically emotions such as fear, self-gratification, paranoia, etc.
But intelligent machines running cortical algorithms wouldn't have
emotions such as these and would just be tools.<br>
<br>
I wonder if you could get as effective and adaptable of an intelligence
without emotions. Or how effective communication between machine
intelligence and biological intelligences would be without the former
having some inkling of the latter's genetic heritage.<br>
<br>
{quote Intelligence could be traced over three epochs, each using
memory and prediction. The first would be when species used DNA as the
medium for memory. Individuals could not learn and adapth within their
lifetimes. They could only pass on the DNA-based memory of the world to
their offspring through their genes.<br>
<br>
The second epoch began when nature invented modifiable nervous systems
that could quickly form memories. An individual could now learn about
the structure of its world and adapt its behavior accordingly within
its lifetime. But an individual still could not communicate this
knowledge to its offspring other than by direct observation [ed. note:
and genes]. The creation and expansion of the neocortex occurred within
this second epoch, but did not define it.<br>
<br>
The third and final epoch is unique to humans. It begins with the
invention of language and the expansion of our large neocortex. We
humans can learn a lot of the structure of the world within our
lifetimes, and we can effectively communicate this to many other humans
via language.}</div>

Small businesses in Emilia-Romagna are also structurally different from
the typical small business in the United States. They're not simple
suppliers of components to a big companies that lay down the law. In
Emilia-Romagna, small firms compete for contracts. But, as a matter of
custom and practicality, the winners hire the losers as subcontractors.
And there is none of our famous industrial dualism, where workers in
small firms must put up with low wages and slim benefits. In exchange
for Italy's highest benefits and wages, workers are flexible: They move
easily among firms. Similarly, skills and marketing information travel
easily among local suppliers.</div>

The government provides what Bolognese economist Sebastiano Brusco
calls "real services" -- not just those that make up for market
failures, like unemployment compensation and welfare, but services that
enable people to work. Emilia-Romagna's female participation in the
labor force is the highest in Italy. In part this is because there is a
century-old Emilian tradition of women working outside the home, but it
is also the result of a strong, independent female workers' movement
for adequate daycare. (Today in Modena, about two-thirds of children
are in nursery school, as opposed to 4 percent in Naples.)<br>
<br>
The beneficiaries of "real services" are people working in small and
medium enterprises. In the United States, we usually think of small
businesses not only as firms that pay low wages but as especially
hostile to any government intervention. Neither is true in
Emilia-Romagna. With only 3.9 million people, the region has an amazing
68,000 manufacturing enterprises. (New York State, by contrast, has 18
million people and about 26,000 manufacturing enterprises.) No
invisible hand provides Emilian firms with financing, daycare, urban
planning, technical assistance, research institutes and specialized
laboratories. Small companies can't be expected to devote much capital
to research and development. They can't even afford to hire marketing
consultants. The regional government arranges for these services --
chiefly by contracting with nonprofit economic research agencies like
the internationally respected NOMISMA.</div>

The subprime mortgage crisis has hit. America is homeless, broke,
foreclosed, and in the midst of a financial crisis. Similar to when

Combine this with Sowell's "Basic Economics" to address Foley's "Adam's
Fallacy" talks about economic theology as a fallacy whereby short-term
economic gains transform into vague long-term societal gains, which is
the cornerstone of Smith's theory. Foley also asserts that Smith
&amp;co's theories do not mention distribution of wealth, only
production of it.<br>
<br>
I believe (and need to prove) that the selfish economic pursuits of man
lead to positive societal gains mainly through the development of
technology. Automation and scientific breakthroughs (e.g., new alloys)
are the source of societal justice and are created fastest in the
capitalist milieu.<br>
<br>
Supply and demand drive prices up and down, and sometimes drive them to
0 (e.g., saddles after the Model T). This seems unfair locally but is
societally net a good thing. Conversely it is through high prices that
an inventor is spurred into action.<br>
<br>
To distribute societal wealth leads to tempering of the inventive
spirit and therefore according to my hypothesis leads to economic,
cultural, and social stagnation.<br>
<br>
We can prove this either by analyzing the past or experimenting in the present.</div>

Generations ago we would understand thunderstorms perhaps as the
roaring and rumbling about in battle of superhuman gods. Similarly
today, we reduce the storm to various supposed experiences with
friction, sparks, vacuums, and the imagination of bulgeous banks of
burly air smashing together to make the noise. None of these really
exist as we picture them. Our images of these events of physics are as
far from the actuality as fighting gods. Yet they act as the metaphor

Perhaps the easiest way to understand the Japanese market at the time
is to imagine that home computers did not exist. From this perspective,
the direction that the Japanese electronics industry took makes perfect
sense. Everything needed to be designed as stand-alone appliance. The
basis for much of this was the digital memory card, particularly the SD
card. Digital cameras and camera-phones stored everything on a memory
stick, and offered DPOF configuration options for configuring printing
options. Color printers went on sale offering SD card slots so that
these photos could be printed without a computer in the middle. MP3
players took a similar turn, offering either analog cable connectivity
or SD card slots for music transfers. New stereo systems also offered
an additional SD card slot. The SD card was like the new cassette.
Record stores even began offering machines that sold digital music
directly stored on your SD card. 3G phone handsets were released in
2001, and Japanese telecoms envisioned a world where consumers would
buy and download music directly onto their mobile phones. It all makes
sense if nobody owns a home computer, and when the mobile phone is the
dominant form of Internet connectivity.</div>

RepRap is short for Replicating Rapid-prototyper. It is the practical

This technology already exists, but the cheapest commercial machine
would cost you about €30,000. And it isn't even designed so that it can
make itself. So what the RepRap team are doing is to develop and to
give away the designs for a much cheaper machine with the novel
capability of being able to self-copy (material costs are about €400).
That way it's accessible to small communities in the developing world
as well as individuals in the developed world. Following the principles

I do recognize that many investors are bullish on the basis of
commodities, fertilizer, basic materials and all sorts of
scarcity-oriented investment themes. There are plenty of ways for
investors to speculate on that sort of theme if they believe that “this
time it's different” and we have entered a new world of permanent
global shortages (no reason to convince me of it – just speculate
elsewhere). As for me, I continue to believe that the best long-term
investment opportunities will come from well-run companies with
reasonable valuations, financial stability, and creative, useful
products, just as durable long-term investment opportunities always
have. So while investors clamor to buy stocks that fit into a
pessimistic theme of global scarcity, famine and energy shortages, I'm

The people working on the Semantic Web greatly overestimate the value
of deductive reasoning (a persistent theme in Artificial Intelligence
projects generally.) The great popularizer of this error was Arthur
Conan Doyle, whose Sherlock Holmes stories have done more damage to
people's understanding of human intelligence than anyone other than
Rene Descartes. Doyle has convinced generations of readers that what
seriously smart people do when they think is to arrive at inevitable
conclusions by linking antecedent facts. As Holmes famously put it
"when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however
improbable, must be the truth."<br>
<br>
This sentiment is attractive precisely because it describes a world
simpler than our own. In the real world, we are usually operating with
partial, inconclusive or context-sensitive information. When we have to
make a decision based on this information, we guess, extrapolate,
intuit, we do what we did last time, we do what we think our friends
would do or what Jesus or Joan Jett would have done, we do all of those
things and more, but we almost never use actual deductive logic.</div>

Drucker made observation his life's work, gleaning deceptively simple
ideas that often elicited startling results. Shortly after Welch became
CEO of General Electric in 1981, for example, he sat down with Drucker
at the company's New York headquarters. Drucker posed two questions
that arguably changed the course of Welch's tenure: "If you weren't
already in a business, would you enter it today?" he asked. "And if the
answer is no, what are you going to do about it?"<br>
<br>
Those questions led Welch to his first big transformative idea: that
every business under the GE umbrella had to be either No. 1 or No. 2 in
its class. If not, Welch decreed that the business would have to be
fixed, sold, or closed. It was the core strategy that helped Welch
remake GE into one of the most successful American corporations of the
past 25 years.</div>

So what is Sage and what makes it unique? Sage is:<br>
<br>
   1. a huge distribution of free open source mathematical software<br>
      that is surprisingly easy to build from source,<br>
   2. a set of interfaces to most other mathematical software<br>
      systems, and<br>
3. a new Python library that fills in huge gaps in other open source
math software included in Sage, unifies everything offering a smooth
user experience, and provides a modern web-based graphical notebook
interface with math typesetting and integrated 2D and 3D graphics.<br>
<br>
Sage is the first large general purpose mathematics software system
that uses a mainstream programing language (Python) as the end user
language. Python--easily one of the world's top 10 programming
languages--is a powerful and beautiful modern interpreted programming
language with an organized and professional developer base and millions
of users. Sage also makes extensive use of a Python-to-C compiler
called Cython. Thus Sage has a tremendous advantage over every other
general purpose computer algebra system, since Python has thousands of
third party libraries, sophisticated support for object serialization,
databases, distributed programming, and a major following in scientific
computing.<br>

When you don't watch T.V. you have a lot of spare time on your hands.
What is a person to do with all this spare time? One could make a
"list" and then when the fancy strikes him, he could do something on
that list and blog how the feat was done. Note that the list is not a
set of goals (loose 10lb in 1 month, or do xyz in x time) These are all
things that can be done at a whim, or 2 to 3 whims. Some do require
some planning, but all of these can be done without waiting on anyone.</div>

Many of these holographers would go on to produce art holograms. In
1983, Fred Unterseher published the Holography Handbook, a remarkably
easy to read description of making holograms at home. This brought in a
new wave of holographers and gave simple methods to use the then
available AGFA silver halide recording materials.<br>
<br>
In 2000 Frank DeFreitas published the Shoebox Holography Book and
introduced using inexpensive laser pointers to countless hobbiests.
This was a very important development for amateurs as it took the cost
for a 5mw laser from $1200 to $5. Now there are hundreds to thousands
of amateur holographers worldwide.</div>

"We should remember that not all time is interchangeable; just because
you're up to spending 4 hours zonked out watching TV in bed does not
mean you are up for spending 4 hours doing useful cognitive work."
--phaedrus<br>
<br>
This statement is somewhat wrong. I gave up T.V. about 3 years ago and
this may have been true at first, but as you go on you realize that
when you feel tired you are usually just bored, and need to do
something. If you are really tired then go to sleep, don't stay awake
forcing yourself to be entertained (gorging when you eat?)<br>
<br>
It isn't Just T.V. that is bad. Anything that updates is bad since you
come back over and over looking for a new fix of "something new"; I've
found this activity extremely draining on your ability to go out and do
new things; you drop into a mode of wanting to do to a mode of just
wanting things to come to you to entertain you. This means that the
internet is almost as bad as T.V. (if not worse, more content to surf
around) Think of all the things that are currently popular : myspace,
youtube, stumble, facebook..etc.. Almost exactly like T.V. People go to
those sites to zone out and have information handed to them. The same
goes for email, people keep checking their mailboxes hoping to have a
new nugget of joy that will keep them busy for a few more minutes.<br>
<br>
I started off With No T.V. (cold turkey), I used Movies to supplement
the cravings, then I started cutting back on movies, not because I was
trying to cut back on them, but because I just don't find them
interesting any more. Next I cut out all forms of gossip and news from
the internet. Pretty much anything that you read that can make you
angry from either a) "how stupid" the person writing it is, or b) how
anything like "that" could ever happen, you just need to cut it out;
why do you want to work yourself up? This would include sites like
slashdot.org, digg, reddit..etc. After cutting these sites out, my over
all mood has become much better; those sites just contain thoughts that
do you know good what so ever. (How did I read this to be posting on
it? Someone sent me the link. Which is a great system; if something is
worth knowing, someone will tell you.) After giving up most every news
site (they are all tripe that just spread gossip and violence.) I
started reading just "creative" blogs (make magazine for example.)
Recently I have found that It doesn't matter what you read, since
you'll end up just going back to be "entertained". Why is this bad?
Because you switch off, you might think to yourself that you'll get
inspired by reading inspiring blogs, but you won't. What you'll find
out if you are paying attention is that most blogs are just recycled
content over and over; there are very few original ideas out there.<br>
<br>
After giving up almost all forms of "updating" sources. I have found
that I no longer have enough time in a day to do all the stuff I want
to get done. If I feel too tired even to read a book (not usable energy
as someone stated.) then I go to bed.<br>
<br>
There are millions of things to do out there, you just need to find them.<br>
<br>
One other mistake I made was when trying to learn a lot of new things I
would bounce around between them, which isn't bad, but I found that
when I got stuck learning something new, I would switch over to doing
something else, which is bad. So If you plan on learning new things,
set a time for yourself. If you start an activity stay with it for at
least 1 hour (or whatever) to make sure that if you hit a wall you work
your way over it instead of moving on to something else. Also, I have
found that keep a journal of all the things you learn to be very
useful. Whenever you have some free time, you can read through the past
things you have learned to refresh your memory.<br>
<br>
You can respond to this comment all you want, but as stated i've pretty
much given up this type of entrainment (blogs) altogether and I'm just
here because someone sent me the link; I wrote this in hopes that it
may help some people that are moving down this path already. If you
think this was all dumb crap (maybe it is, life systems change over
your life.) , well then don't use it. If you have any questions:

As for agricultural commodities, what we are observing is probably not
a Malthusian breakpoint, but what I'd call “speculative hoarding.”
Essentially, as the prices of commodities rise, particularly in
developing nations, there is a tendency to save in the form of real
goods. We've observed this historically in various countries as
hoarding of every form of physical output, even spoons and other
household items.<br>
<br>
Supporting that thesis of speculative hoarding, it's interesting that
on Wednesday, a news piece came out on Bloomberg noting “Wal-Mart
Stores Inc's Sam's Club warehouse unit is restricting the purchase of
some rice to four bags a visit because of ‘recent supply and demand
trends.' Some consumers have started hoarding rice, the food staple for
half the world, as supplies shrink. Some of Costco Wholesale Corp's
stores, including locations in California, have put limits on sales of
rice and flour, Chief Executive Officer James Sinegal told Reuters
yesterday.”<br>
<br>
In effect, we are observing a version of tulip-mania with foodstuffs. I
would expect that prices will reach a speculative peak, probably within
a few months, and then most probably plummet with very little in the
way of relief rallies. That is a fairly predictable dynamic once
commodity price movements reach the parabolic stage that they have
entered lately. Still, it's not clear how high that parabola will
ascend, because as the slope goes vertical, small differences in the
exact point of the bust will lead to substantial differences in the
price at the high. But the world has more arable land and more capacity
to bring it into use within months and years than should cause
near-term concern about a Malthuisan breakpoint.</div>

This is but one reason that, all other things remaining equal, I always
hire pilots into my start-ups whenever I can, at all levels of the
organization, and especially in the top ranks. Where a non-pilot may
take a superior attitude to others on his or her team who came to the
company with less impressive résumés, good pilots know that there is
something valuable to be learned – possibly something life-saving -
from even the youngest person, way low on the totem pole, who has
nevertheless been at the entrepreneurship game longer. Non-pilots (and
especially their spouses) often misunderstand why we spend so much time
“hanger flying” with our fellow aviators, and reading magazine articles
about harrowing experiences of other pilots – some living to live to
tell about it, others written by accident investigators. They do this
because it is easier and ultimately more prudent to learn from others’
mistakes rather than learning by making your own mistakes. As we know,
man is the only creature with the ability to learn from others’
mistakes, yet often refuses to do so, bound and determined to create
his own lesson plans by repeating avoidable missteps.</div>

Goodman: What is the localvore movement?<br>
<br>
Pollan: The localvore movement is a real new emphasis on eating
locally, eating food from what's called your foodshed. It's a metaphor
based on a watershed. You know, a certain -- draw a circle of a hundred
miles around your community and try to eat everything from there. It's
an interesting movement, and I'm very supportive of local food. I think
that it's verging on the ridiculous right now -- I mean, you know,
because, frankly, there's no wheat produced in a hundred miles of New
York. You know, do you want to give up bread? I'm not willing to give
up bread. So people get a little extremist about it.<br>
<br>
But the basic idea of when products are available locally, eating them
and eating food in season, is a very powerful and important idea. It
supports a great many values. The fact is that food that's produced
locally is going to be fresher. It's going to be more nutritious
because it's fresher. You're going to support the farmers in your
community.</div>

Nutritionism is the prevailing ideology in the whole world of food. And
it's not a science. It is an ideology. And like most ideologies, it is
a set of assumptions about how the world works that we're totally
unaware of. And nutritionism, there's a few fundamental tenets to it.
One is that food is a collection of nutrients, that basically the sum
of -- you know, food is the sum of the nutrients it contains. The other
is that since the nutrient is the key unit and, as ordinary people, we
can't see or taste or feel nutrients, we need experts to help us design
our foods and tell us how to eat.<br>
<br>
Another assumption of nutritionism is that you can measure these
nutrients and you know what they're doing, that we know what
cholesterol is and what it does in our body or what an antioxidant is.
And that's a dubious proposition.</div>

The only way to create a continually moist, nutrient-rich soil
ecosystem is to slow down the escape of these critical nutrients and
water from the soil. Nature has chipped away at this challenge for 450
million years-the approximate amount of time that life has existed on
land-and has come up with a “living soil” that continually cycles the
important ingredients of life in place, rather than letting them
escape. The home gardener can emulate nature and create vibrant soil,
even here amid the rocky regolith of the Methow Valley.<br>
<br>
Take nitrogen for example. This element is critical to plant growth.
For better and for worse most of the world’s supply of this element is
in the atmosphere, which is 78% nitrogen. It exists there as N2, two
atoms that are chemically so tightly bound together that they are
useless to plants. Eons ago, when bacteria were the only life on the
planet, certain bacterial species developed a method of splitting
atmospheric nitrogen apart in order to incorporate it into their own
chemistry. We know of these today as the nitrogen-fixing bacteria that
live on the roots of the Legume Family (which includes peas, beans and
alfalfa) and a few other plant genera (in our area, alder, bitterbrush,
Sheperdia and Ceanothus are all hosts to nitrogen-fixing bacteria).
There are also free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil.</div>

A growing number of people are beginning to realize that not only have
so-called human “progress” and “civilization” led us to the point where
we now stand on the edge of an ecological catastrophe, they have also
been the cause of a growing human disaster. Granted, a relatively small
minority of the world’s people lives the so-called “good life” in the
(over-)developed countries, but only at the cost of dire poverty,
suffering and injustice for the majority of the world’s people and
increasingly severe global environmental degradation, to the point that
almost all life on earth is now threatened. And as the rates of cancer,
diabetes, depression and other dis-eases of civilization continue to
skyrocket, even many of the supposedly affluent are beginning to
realize that their material wealth has not brought them true ease,
health and happiness. Thus we have, for example, the growing popularity
of the “simple living” movement in the over-developed countries.</div>

that archaeology is a luxury, concerned with the remote past and
offering no lessons for the present. Archaeologists studying the rise
of farming have reconstructed a crucial stage at which we made the
worst mistake in human history. Forced to choose between limiting
population or trying to increase food production, we chose the latter
and ended up with starvation, warfare, and tyranny. Hunter-gatherers
practiced the most successful and longest-lasting life style in human
history. In contrast, we’re still struggling with the mess into which

The Romans never allowed a trouble spot to remain simply to avoid going

are only postponed to someone else's advantage. Therefore, they made

them in Italy... They never went by that saying which you constantly

I was recently reminded of some reading I did in college, way back in
the last century, by a British historian arguing that the critical
technology, for the early phase of the industrial revolution, was gin.<br>
<br>
The transformation from rural to urban life was so sudden, and so
wrenching, that the only thing society could do to manage was to drink
itself into a stupor for a generation. The stories from that era are
amazing-- there were gin pushcarts working their way through the
streets of London.<br>
<br>
And it wasn't until society woke up from that collective bender that we
actually started to get the institutional structures that we associate
with the industrial revolution today. Things like public libraries and
museums, increasingly broad education for children, elected leaders--a
lot of things we like--didn't happen until having all of those people
together stopped seeming like a crisis and started seeming like an
asset.<br>
<br>
It wasn't until people started thinking of this as a vast civic
surplus, one they could design for rather than just dissipate, that we
started to get what we think of now as an industrial society.<br>
<br>
<br>
If I had to pick the critical technology for the 20th century, the bit
of social lubricant without which the wheels would've come off the
whole enterprise, I'd say it was the sitcom. Starting with the Second
World War a whole series of things happened--rising GDP per capita,
rising educational attainment, rising life expectancy and, critically,
a rising number of people who were working five-day work weeks. For the
first time, society forced onto an enormous number of its citizens the
requirement to manage something they had never had to manage
before--free time.<br>
<br>
<br>
And what did we do with that free time? Well, mostly we spent it watching TV.</div>

A traditional computer program consists of a text file containing
program code. Scattered in amongst the program code are comments which
describe the various parts of the code.<br>
<br>
In literate programming the emphasis is reversed. Instead of writing
code containing documentation, the literate programmer writes
documentation containing code. No longer does the English commentary
injected into a program have to be hidden in comment delimiters at the
top of the file, or under procedure headings, or at the end of lines.
Instead, it is wrenched into the daylight and made the main focus. The
"program" then becomes primarily a document directed at humans, with
the code being herded between "code delimiters" from where it can be
extracted and shuffled out sideways to the language system by literate
programming tools.</div>

In my experience, software created with literate programming has turned
out to be significantly better than software developed in more
traditional ways. Yet ordinary software is usually okay—I’d give it a
grade of C (or maybe C ), but not F; hence, the traditional methods
stay with us. Since they’re understood by a vast community of

In other words, the harder you have to work to get the right answer,
the more the answer is sealed in memory. Precisely those things that

SuperMemo is a program that keeps track of discrete bits of information
you've learned and want to retain. For example, say you're studying
Spanish. Your chance of recalling a given word when you need it
declines over time according to a predictable pattern. SuperMemo tracks
this so-called forgetting curve and reminds you to rehearse your
knowledge when your chance of recalling it has dropped to, say, 90
percent. When you first learn a new vocabulary word, your chance of
recalling it will drop quickly. But after SuperMemo reminds you of the
word, the rate of forgetting levels out. The program tracks this new
decline and waits longer to quiz you the next time.</div>

"Much learning does not teach understanding."<br>
<br>
- Heraclitus<br>
<br> Currently there are two models of the American economy, one
static, and the other dynamic. The first portrays the United States as
a caste system and misapplies the characteristics of a permanent income
strata to those only temporarily moving through income brackets. The
alternative view portrays a much more complex and interesting social
reality in which the composition of income classes are in constant
flux. According to this latter point of view, simplistic
generalizations about actual persons and families (or "the rich" and
"the poor") cannot be drawn from data on a conceptual artifice which
does not exist as such in reality.</div>

For example, working for a big company is the default thing to do, at
least for programmers. How bad could it be? Well, food shows that
pretty clearly. If you were dropped at a random point in America today,
nearly all the food around you would be bad for you. Humans were not
designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup,
and hydrogenated vegetable oil. And yet if you analyzed the contents of
the average grocery store you'd probably find these four ingredients
accounted for most of the calories. "Normal" food is terribly bad for
you. The only people who eat what humans were actually designed to eat
are a few Birkenstock-wearing weirdos in Berkeley.<br>
<br>
If "normal" food is so bad for us, why is it so common? There are two
main reasons. One is that it has more immediate appeal. You may feel
lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the first couple
bites feels great. The other is economies of scale. Producing junk food
scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn't. Which means (a) junk food
can be very cheap, and (b) it's worth spending a lot to market it.<br>
<br>
If people have to choose between something that's cheap, heavily
marketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that's
expensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do you think
most will choose?</div>

Historically the unit of concurrency in an operating system is the
‘user’ – a given process should think it is the only user on the
computer. An O/S process should have access to full range of
functionality of the physical machine. The O/S process doesn’t actually
talk to the hardware – it talks to the O/S which handles the hardware
on its behalf.<br>
<br>
In an A/S the application system itself runs as an O/S process. If an
A/S process wants access to the full range of O/S resources is asks the
A/S to access them on its behalf.<br>
<br>
Given that O/S’s have a user (or an anthropomorphic batch user) as
their basic unit of concurrency it comes as no surprise to find that
the upper limits on O/S concurrency tend to mirror the upper limit of
concurrent sign-ons for timesharing machines – 4,000 to 8,000
concurrent objects.<br>
<br>
In order to get around this limitation many applications use an
alternative mechanism of concurrency – the dreaded thread. Unlike
processes, threads share state and software errors propagate between
them. The threaded model in applications has its analogue in operating
system design. There was a very popular operating system that didn’t
impose memory page writing constraints between applications – they all
shared state. MS-Dos was enormously successful, for a while, but it
had, a-hem, stability issues.<br>
<br>
By comparison with O/S process, Erlang processes are a lot more
lightweight with an upper limit of tens or hundreds of thousands of
concurrent processes – if they want heavy lifting they just ask the
Erlang Virtual Machine. Critically the Erlang Virtual Machine doesn’t
rely on the operating system scheduler to time share between its
processes. The VM is just another anthropomorphic batch user receiving
one time slice at a time from the Operating System. Its own
time-slicer/scheduler parcels that clock-tick amongst its own internal
A/S processes. And the VM underlying the Application System has to
replicate a whole host of constructs familiar from Operating System
design like spawning processes and loading code. This can be of great
benefit, as when, for instance, the Erlang code loader is used to hot
load changes – running processes are invited to swap themselves out for
newer versions whilst executing.</div>

Individual Starfaring Races: Seven Spin Clans<br>
The Seven Spin Clans are machine creatures left from the AI (artificial
intelligence) wars of 280 million years ago (see "Revolt of the Data"
in Timeline section). Unlike many digital races, they have official
status in the Civilization of Five Galaxies, having gone to great
lengths to assuage the almost instinctive fears of oxygen-breathing
sapients feel toward autonomous robots. The Foresight Institute
inspects regularly to make sure that both hardware and software follows
rigorous procedures, to prevent unbridled reproduction.<br>
<br>
There are hundreds of makes and models within the clan, and thousands
of variations. Indeed, the Spin Clans mainly consist of solitary
individuals that constantly redesign themselves, hiring out for complex
tasks in widely dispersed locales. On rare occasion, a or so clan
members will gather to work on a single short-term project. They also
prove useful working with the Zang and other hydrogen-breathing races.<br>
<br>
Though they have been socially ostracized by most of the Oxy races of
the Five Galaxies, Earth would like to establish diplomatic relations
with this clan. If you meet sophisticated machine minds out there,
express our interest. Promise nothing. Ask them to come by our embassy
at Horst for a visit. But remind them to be discreeet.</div>

A liquidity crisis is when you write a check for more than the amount
in your checking account. You suddenly realize that you need to sell a
big securities position to cover it, but selling everything at once
might only get you “fire sale” prices. In this case, you need a loan
for a few weeks to give you time to work out of your securities
position. Without that short-term “liquidity,” the check might bounce
even though you really do have the assets to pay it off. In contrast, a
solvency crisis is when the only asset you have to cover that check is
an IOU from your Uncle Ernie, who keeps promising “I'll pay you every
dime as soon as I win it back on the ponies.”</div>

until 1908, scientists routinely used the laws of physics to rule out
the possibility that man would ever fly. Five years after their first
successful flight, and in spite of many public demonstrations, the
Wright Brothers' invention was still being ridiculed as a hoax in the
press and scientific community. It was not until President Theodore
Roosevelt ordered public trials that the Wrights were finally
vindicated.<br>
<br>
Did Johann Bessler, like the Wright Brothers, employ an unknown physical principle to achieve the "impossible?"<br>
<br>
Simon Newcomb, after proving that human flight was "utterly
impossible," conceded that it might one day be possible, but only by
the discovery of some entirely new material or force of nature. In
essence, that is what happened. The Wright Brothers employed principles
of Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics that were completely unknown to
Physics at the time.</div>

When archeologists uncovered the grave of a sixth-century Saxon king at
Sutton Hoo in eastern Britain, for example, the pottery found among the
grave goods told an astonishing tale of technical collapse. Had it been
made in fourth century Britain, the Sutton Hoo pottery would have been
unusually crude for a peasant farmhouse; two centuries later, it sat on
the table of a king. What’s more, much of it had to be imported,
because so simple a tool as a potter’s wheel dropped entirely out of
use in post-Roman Britain, as part of a cascading collapse that took
Britain down to levels of economic and social complexity not seen there
since the subsistence crises of the middle Bronze Age more than a
thousand years before. </div>

In Laws of Media (1988) and The Global Village (1989), published
posthumously, Marshall McLuhan summarized his ideas about media in a
concise tetrad of media effects. The tetrad is a means of examining the
effects on society of any technology (i.e., any medium) by dividing its
effects into four categories and displaying them simultaneously.
McLuhan designed the tetrad as a pedagogical tool, phrasing his laws as
questions with which to consider any medium:<br>
<br>
    * What does the medium enhance?<br>
    * What does the medium make obsolete?<br>
    * What does the medium retrieve that had been obsolesced earlier?<br>
    * What does the medium flip into when pushed to extremes?<br>
<br>
The laws of the tetrad exist simultaneously, not successively or
chronologically, and allow the questioner to explore the "grammar and
syntax" of the "language" of media.</div>

Any technology tends to create a new human environment. Script and
papyrus created the social environment we think of in connection with
the empires of the ancient world. The stirrup and the wheel created
unique environments of enormous scope. Technological environments are
not merely passive containers of people but are active processes that
reshape people and other technologies alike. In our time the sudden
shift from the mechanical technology of the wheel to the technology of
electric circuitry represents one of the major shifts of all historical
time. Printing from movable types created a quite unexpected new
environment---it created the *public.* Manuscript technology did not
have the intensity or power of extension necessary to create publics on
a national scale. What we have called "nations" in recent centuries did
not, and could not, precede the advent of Gutenberg technology any more
than they can survive the advent of electric circuitry with its power
of totally involving all people in all other people.</div>

Skeletal thoughts for free markets. <br>
<br>
In the static and extremely short-term view, the current situation in "free market" societies seems unforgivable.<br>
<br>
Most of my peers and I associate wealth with doing something right. We
suspect that while many fortunes may have been made through rapine, far
fewer today go this route than before the free markets began, simply
because it's so much easier to make money honestly (if not sustainably).<br>
<br>
It is incredibly easy to make money. I know people who paint other
people's houses who are millionaires. People who started out mortgaging
a carwash. I don't want you to be offended in any way but I think this
point of view can only take hold when one has little real experience
with making money-products (getting paid by a customer) as well as
little experience with the attitudes and lifestyles of the poor who are
the recipients of income distribution ideas.<br>
<br>
My sister-in-law-to-be (a CPA) tells us about her days as a Big Sister,
working with inner city families, where there'd be no food in the
fridge but the mom will have done up hair.<br>
<br>
It's totally true that the crushing poverty that my family left behind
in India penalizes its victims without mercy, and it requires
superhuman courage combined with luck (this tells you what I think of
my two parents who independently came from complete poverty to beat the
system, meeting in after-college training at the same work facility) to
escape. I don't feel that the poor millions in India are lazy. But I do
believe that the free market approach will, and in fact is currently
raising far more people's standard of living far higher than the
previous system could.<br>
<br>
Standard of living is life expectancy, number of man-hours worked per
unit of real production (as in, what someone paid for your output).<br>
<br>
The know-how, the supply chains, the manufacturing centers, and distribution chains.<br>
<br>
I think though that you don't support a bureaucratic approach to a
wealth distribution system as an alternative to the free market which
you loathe and which I can live with. But the reason that I'm at all
interested in economic democracy is that I think it's the natural
extension to free markets, not at all any kind of replacement. I think
that more sustainable (if non-exponential) profits can be obtained
through ecologies of small employee-owned businesses, where 'profits'
concretely mean customer-driven sales, not government-mandated constant
demand (such as for auto insurance) or government-granted monopoly
(like the FDA). I'm in the process of coming up with an
empirically-tested methodology for business management deriving from
our belief that such a system of novel product design and product
manufacturing can result in far more efficiency and innovation.<br>
<br>
Nationalizing health care will only make static the current system of
doctoring and greatly hamper the development of novel health care
provision systems as well as breakthroughs in research. I don't present
this as a regurgitation of someone's theory but simply transferring my
knowledge of engineering systems to doctoring.</div>

Doing what people want is not the only way to get money, of course. You
could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly. Such
tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for some of the
biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root cause of
variation in income. The root cause of variation in income, as Occam's
Razor implies, is the same as the root cause of variation in every
other human skill.</div>

Part of the reason this subject is so contentious is that some of those
most vocal on the subject of wealth—university students, heirs,
professors, politicians, and journalists—have the least experience
creating it. (This phenomenon will be familiar to anyone who has
overheard conversations about sports in a bar.)<br>
<br>
Students are mostly still on the parental dole, and have not stopped to
think about where that money comes from. Heirs will be on the parental
dole for life. Professors and politicians live within socialist eddies
of the economy, at one remove from the creation of wealth, and are paid
a flat rate regardless of how hard they work. And journalists as part
of their professional code segregate themselves from the
revenue-collecting half of the businesses they work for (the ad sales
department). Many of these people never come face to face with the fact
that the money they receive represents wealth—wealth that, except in
the case of journalists, someone else created earlier.</div>

I use a nice field of view calculator which will give angular field of
view in degrees for horizontal, vertical and diagonal with whatever
format and focal length you want to throw at it. I hate all this
nonsensical "crop factor" stuff. Why not just talk in terms of
horizontal field of view, or diagonal field of view. The calculator is
available at http://www.mat.uc.pt/~rps/phot os/angles.html.<br>
<br>
The usual "crop factor" is based on the relative length of the sensor
diagonals, but 4/3 System format has a different format proportion
compared to 35mm and Canon's 1.6x crop sensors, so the equivalent focal
lengths are always approximate. Here are some precise numbers based on
a Canon sensor size of 14.8 x 22.2 mm, an Olympus sensor size at 13 x
17.3 mm, and 35mm film at 24 x 36 mm, with 200mm, 150mm and 300mm
lenses respectively:<br>

The necklace grows out of Fuller's insistence that every child is born
a genius-endlessly curious, probing, full of wonder about everything.
If a child's questions are rewarded with answers that feel right, that
is, correspond to his experience, the inherent genius will blossom.
More often, not challenged creatively by tedious memorization that
doesn't seem to relate to the world around him, a child simply learns
to play the game. Fuller's conviction that children spontaneously leap
at the chance to understand Universe when excited by true and
comprehensive information was a primary motivating force behind

From the introduction by Robert McChesney:<br>
<br>
What is unusual---perhaps unprecedented---is for a working journalist
to take on the industry in which he or she works. ... He is breaking
the implicit code of silence that compels journalists to look the other
way when the issue turns to how corporate control and commercial
pressures have distorted and degraded our communication system.<br>
<br>
This is not to suggest that the many working journalists who may well
sympathize with Danny Schechter are cowards because they refuse to
speak up. One of the important functions of the profession of
journalism is to make journalists and the public regard issues of
ownership and control as unimportant to explaining how the media
operate. It is worth noting that professional journalism was born
almost a century ago precisely during the era that newspaper ownership
was consolidating and advertising was becoming the primary means of
support. Urged on by the largest publishers, professional journalism
was supposed to assure readers that the news could not be influenced by
owners or advertisers or the biases of the journalists themselves.<br>
<br>
In fact, as Ben Bagdikian has pointed out, professional journalism
internalized the overall political values of the owners and
advertisers, and recognized a decontextualized "neutral" coverage based
upon "official sources" as legitimate news. ...<br>
<br>
But increasingly concentrated corporate ownership and
hyper-commercialism, along with the complicity of the political
establishment that benefits from a depoliticized citizenry, have
effectively destroyed the autonomy and democratic capacity of
journalism over the past 15 years. In 1982, Bagdikian calculated that
fewer than 50 conglomerates dominated the US media, and that figure
seemed scandalous at the time. By 1997, he put the figure at around 10
enormous firms, after waves and waves of mergers and acquisitions. As
recently as the 1950s, most journalism was produced by firms that
devoted the lion's share of their resources to that enterprise; today
the largest news gathering organizations are part of entertainment
empires owned by firms like Disney and Time Warner. Journalism, like
amusement parks, TV shows, action movies, and music CDs, exists to
generate profit, pure and simple. And in this brave new world, a firm's
journalism is required to support its other commercial activities, not
to mention its political objectives. ...<br>
<br>
Indeed, one of the growth industries of the 1990s is of journalists who
have thrown in the towel on the profession and have moved into
academia, retirement or some other field. Numerous memoirs and exposes
of journalism have been published. Entire shelves at the library
include books by people like ex-*Chicago Tribute* editor James Squires
or former CBS legend Walter Cronkite bemoaning the death of journalism
at the hands of Wall Street, Hollywood, and Madison Avenue. All of
these studies link the decline in political understanding, debate, and
participation, to the tabloidization and commercialization of
journalism. ...<br>
<br>
Nobody understands these issues quite like Danny Schechter. He combines
a remarkable understanding of the best scholarship on the topic with
the street smarts of a working journalist who knows who to cut through
the bull and get to the point. He develops his critique while providing
us with a lively tour through his remarkable career at Boston's WBCN,
Harvard's Nieman Fellowship Program, CNN, ABC News, and as the producer
of the brilliant public television programs *South Africa Now* and
*Rights &amp; Wrongs.*<br>
<br>
The corporate media giants, advertisers, and other powerful forces that
benefit by the status quo have no interest in encouraging the
discussion. It is quite all right to bash the media for its alleged
"liberal" bias; indeed, our airwaves are dominated by millionaire
right-wingers who constantly assert such claims with no sense of irony.
But it is strictly forbidden for there to be a candid analysis of the
implications of corporate media control on our journalism, culture and
democracy.<br>
<br>
Unlike most of the other critics, however, Danny Schechter hasn't
thrown in the towel on journalism or the possibility of changing this
nation for the better. ... The solution is not for journalists or
citizens to put their heads in the sand and pretend nothing is wrong;
that option is no longer tenable. The solution is to tell the truth,
actively discuss and debate the situation, and seek out workable
solutions. And any solution will have to involve structural changes
that reduce the amount of control corporate executives have over media
content, and increase the diversity of viable noncommercial media. <br>
<br>
Danny Schechter also rightly emphasizes our need to reform our media if
we want to rejuvenate our democracy. Journalism has always been
indelibly linked to democracy, from the passage of the First Amendment
in 1791 to the dictum of "afflicting the comfortable and comforting the
afflicted" in the late 19th century. Journalism should be feisty,
controversial, engaging, and honest. Like politics, it should be fun,
and it should always piss off those in power. Today's journalism has
substituted celebrity lifestyle exposes, trivia, shopping tips, crime
and violence, and subservience to business, for anything remotely
democratic. Little wonder so few young people read or watch the news
anymore. ... <br>
<br>
We need 50, 100, 1,000 Danny Schechters. And we need everyone to take
his words to heart and to begin to demand a media system that serves
our democratic needs rather than the commercial imperatives of a
handful of massive corporations.</div>

From a review:<br>
<br>
Mr Dalrymple shows in essay after essay how the choices the underclass
in Britain make determines their destiny. There are countless parallels
to American life - the rampant gambling that goes on in casinos and in
bingo parlors (and those who cannot stop then blame the casino for
their problem!); the spending of needed cash on lottery tickets; the
horrible standard of education that graduates illiterate young adults
who can barely add in their heads; the ignorance of science, history
and math that students display; women who go from one violent man to
another, making baby after baby with them and then saying they "love
him" and cannot leave him. The stories are pathetic and frustrating
because the "victims" are their own hindrance. They live in some sort
of parallel universe where they have no more control over their
emotions or actions than a squirrel or a worm, and blame their problems
on the government, the bureaucracy, their parents, the pubs, the
casinos, their teachers... everyone carries the victim's sin on their
own shoulders, because the underclass itself is not responsible for
anything.<br>
<br>
Some reviewers have noted that the author does a lot of complaining,
yet has no answers. That is the point of the book, isn't it? There is
no one outside of these people who can change them. More government
agencies? More welfare money? More policemen? What? The entire theme of
the book is the relinquishing of personal responsibility by the
underclass so that they can live and die as they see fit and someone
else can foot the bill. How many young men in Britain are forced to rob
cars, rape women, steal food, skip school, have numerous children by
numerous women, tattoo and pierce themselves, drink themselves silly in
pubs, etc? What magic pill is there for these miscreants that does not
come from inside the individual himself? </div>

The individual feels the futility of human desires and aims and the
sublimity and marvelous order which reveal themselves both in nature
and in the world of thought. Individual existence impresses him as a
sort of prison and he wants to experience the universe as a single
significant whole. The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already
appear at an early stage of development, e.g., in many of the Psalms of
David and in some of the Prophets. Buddhism, as we have learned
especially from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer, contains a much
stronger element of this.</div>

Where Heilbroner celebrates the overlap between economics and other
human activities, Foley criticizes "Adam's Fallacy," the artificial
division between the economic sphere, in which pursuit of self-interest
leads to social good, and the social sphere, in which good results from
unselfish actions. Uncritical acceptance of the fallacy, which the
author labels "economic theology," leads to the belief that short-term
economic gain necessarily favors vague, long-term social gains.
Unemployment and cultural destruction caused by free trade, for
example, are ignored from a naïve faith that unrestrained trade leads
to a greater good for a greater number. Foley finds some brilliance and
rigor in the works of all his subjects, while also accusing them of
sloppy thinking unsupported by data, which has led to heartless,
misguided policies.</div>

Technics is not to be understood in terms of the implement. What
matters is not how one fashions things, but what one does with them...
Every struggle with a problem calls for a logical technique. There is a
technique of the painter's brush-strokes, of horsemanship, of
navigating an airship. Always it is a matter of purposive activity,
never of things. And it is just this that is so often overlooked in the
study of prehistory, in which far too much attention is paid to things
in museums and far too little in the innumerable processes that must
have been in existence, even though they may have vanished without
leaving a trace.<br>
<br>
Every machine serves some one process and owes its existence to thought
about this process. All our means of transport have developed out of
the ideas of driving and rowing, sailing and flying, and not out of any
concept such as that of a wagon or a boat. Methods themselves are
weapons. </div>

Jacopo Belbo, who was almost fifteen years older than I, later
convinced me that every generation feels this way. You are always born
under the wrong sign, and to live in this world properly you have to
rewrite your own horoscope day by day.<br>
<br>
I believe that what we become depends on what our fathers teach us at
odd moments, when they aren’t trying to teach us. We are formed by
little scraps of wisdom. When I was ten, I asked my parents to
subscribe to a weekly magazine that was publishing comic-strip versions
of the great classics of literature. My father, not because he was
stingy, but because he was suspicious of comic strips, tried to beg
off. “The purpose of this magazine,” I pontificated, quoting the ad,
“is to educate the reader in an entertaining way.” “The purpose of your
magazine,” my father replied without looking up from his paper, “is the
purpose of every magazine: to sell as many copies as it can.”<br>
<br>
That day, I began to be incredulous.<br>
<br>
Or, rather, I regretted having been credulous. I regretted having
allowed myself to be borne away by a passion of the mind. Such is
credulity. Not that the incredulous person doesn’t believe in anything.
It’s just that he doesn’t believe in everything. Or he believes in one
thing at a time. He believes a second thing only if it somehow follows
from the first thing. He is nearsighted and methodical, avoiding wide
horizons. If two things don’t fit, but you believe both of them,
thinking that somewhere, hidden, there must be a third thing that
connects them, that’s credulity.<br>
<br>
Incredulity doesn’t kill curiosity; it encourages it. Though
distrustful of logical chains of ideas, I loved the polyphony of ideas.
As long as you don’t believe in them, the collision of two ideas— both
false—can create a pleasing interval, a kind of diabolus in musica. I
had no respect for some ideas people were willing to stake their lives
on, but two or three ideas that I did not respect might still make a
nice melody. Or have a good beat, and if it was jazz, all the better.</div>

At Toyota Motor Company, Taichii Ohno and Shigeo Shingo, began to
incorporate Ford production and other techniques into an approach
called Toyota Production System or Just In Time . They recognized the
central role of inventory.<br>

The Toyota people also recognized that the Ford system had
contradictions and shortcomings, particularly with respect to
employees. With General Douglas MacAurthur actively promoting labor
unions in the occupation years, Ford's harsh attitudes and demeaning
job structures were unworkable in post-war Japan. They were also
unworkable in the American context, but that would not be evident for
some years. America's "Greatest Generation" carried over attitudes from
the Great Depression that made the system work in spite of its defects.<br>

I'm sorry but you are completely wrong on what Jacobs calls "import
replacement." She takes great pains in The Economy of Cities
(especially Chapter 5) to distinguish this from "import substitution,"
which IS a discredited doctrine (and she herself effectively discredits
it no later 1969 than when this book was published). In her system,
imports serve to spur local innovations, some of which can be exported.
While the end of most versions of import *substitution* is
self-sufficiency, import *replacement* is part of a dynamic process in
which local economies network to form dynamically stable global
economies. What's fascinating about this analysis is that Jacobs
emphasized the importance for trade of both diversity of skills and
knowledge and the diversity of tastes, suggesting the importance of the
latter in driving the former.</div>

This story, on Japanese manufacture, is lengthy but so good I have to quote it in full:<br>
<br> Bicycles were extremely popular in Japanese cities at the end of
the nineteenth century, when the import of goods that Japanese
manufactures could not compete with on price — or could not make at all
— was damaging the national economy. Clearly, if bicycles could be made
in Japan, both the massive demand for an individual means of transport
and the national economy would be server at the same time. As Jane
Jacobs points out in her book The Economy of Cities, Japan could have
responded to this challenge by inviting foreign manufacturers to
establish plants in the country — though this would have brought little
profit to the Japanese themselves. Or they could have built a factory
of their own — which would have required large investments in
specialised machinery and the training of a skilled labour force. The
Japanese followed neither of these options. Instead they exploited an
indigenous talent for ‘economic borrowing’ — or imitation, as
non-specialists would call it. It worked like this:<br>
<br> Not long after the importation of bicycles had begun, large
numbers of one- and two-man repair shops sprang up in the cities. Since
imported spare parts were expensive and broken bicycles too valuable to
cannabalise, many repair shops found it worthwhile to make replacement
parts themselves — not difficult if each of the shops specialised in
making only one or two specific parts, as many did. In this way, groups
of bicycle repair shops were in effect manufacturing entire bicycles
before long, and it required only an enterprising individual to begin
buying parts on contract from the repairmen for Japan to have the
beginnings of a home-grown bicycle manufacturing industry.<br>
<br> So, far from being costly to develop, bicycle manufacturing in
Japan paid for itself at every stage of its development. And the
Japanese got much more than a bicycle industry from the exercise. They
had also acquired a model for many of their other industrial
achievements: imitation and a system of reducing complex manufacturing
work to a number of relatively simple operations which could be done in
small autonomous workshops. The pattern was applied to the production
of many other goods, and underwrote the soaring economic success of
Japan during the twentieth century. Sony began life at the end of the
Second World War as a small shop making tubes on contract for radio
assemblers. The first Nikon cameras were exact copies of the Zeiss
Contax; Canon copied the Leica; Toyota Landcruisers were powered by
copies of the Chrysler straight-six engine.</div>

The previous entry refers to another segment of the article:<br>
"Tablet I contains a creation myth about the Sumerian gods Anu, Enlil
and Enki, gods of sky, wind and water, "when gods were in the ways of
men" according to its incipit. Following the casting of lots, heaven is
ruled by Anu, earth by Enlil, and the freshwater sea by Enki. Enlil
assigned junior gods to do farm labor and maintain the rivers and
canals, but after forty years they rebelled and refused to do hard
labor. Instead of punishing the rebels, Enki, who is also the kind,
wise counselor to the gods, suggested that humans be created to do the
work. The mother goddess Mami is assigned the task of creating humans
by shaping clay figurines mixed with the flesh and blood of a slain
god. The under-god Weila or Aw-ilu, was slain for this purpose. After
ten months, a specially made womb breaks open and humans are born.
Tablet I continues with legends about overpopulation and plagues.
Atrahasis is mentioned at the end of Tablet I."<br>
<br>
I am very interested in this kind of syncretism, whereby the myths of
one culture are adopted by another. (e.g., Ishtar, Isis, and the
ancient Greek hearth goddess?) It is the genetics of mythology, of
cultures. I believe Frazer talks at length about this, if only I could
read.</div>

Equality, the Third World and Economic Delusion<br>
 By P. T. Bauer<br>
"Political power enables rulers forcibly to restrict the choices open
to their subjects. But possession of wealth does not by itself confer
such coercive power in this crucial sense. Wealth can sometimes secure
a degree of political influence, although the likelihood and
significance of this possibility are apt to be much exaggerated."

"For society as a whole, nothing comes as a 'right' to which we are
'entitled'. Even bare subsistence has to be produced.... The only way
anyone can have a right to something that has to be produced is to
force someone else to produce it... The more things are provided as
rights, the less the recipients have to work and the more the providers
have to carry the load." Thomas Sowell, quoted in Forbes</div>

to increase computing performance. Erlang, together with languages like

Programming the Cell Processor<br>
It may be tricky, but the performance gains are worth the effort<br>
On a Pentium 4 HT running at 3.4 GHz, this algorithm is able to check
24-million edges per second. On the Cell, at the end of our
optimization, we achieved a performance of 538-million edges per
second. This is an impressive result, but came at the price of an
explosion in code complexity. While the algorithm in Listing One fits
in 60 lines of source code, our final algorithm on the Cell measures
1200 lines of code.</div>

I've encountered more than one Common Lisper who is suspicious of
brevity for the sake of brevity, but the major advantage of Lisp is
supposed to be that you grow your language up to meet your problem.
Today, at least for pedagogical purposes, our problem is we want to
make Common Lisp act a bit more like Matlab. And we are going to do it
with reader macros, since our major aim is to express as concisely as
possible vector operations.</div>

By the way, on the matter of hype: People have always been quick to
announce “the next software development revolution,” usually about
their own brand-new technology. Don’t believe it. New technologies are
often genuinely interesting and sometimes beneficial, but the biggest
revolutions in the way we write software generally come from
technologies that have already been around for some years and have
already experienced gradual growth before they transition to explosive
growth. This is necessary: You can only base a software development
revolution on a technology that’s mature enough to build on (including
having solid vendor and tool support), and it generally takes any new
software technology at least seven years before it’s solid enough to be
broadly usable without performance cliffs and other gotchas. As a
result, true software development revolutions like OO happen around
technologies that have already been undergoing refinement for years,
often decades. Even in Hollywood, most genuine “overnight successes”
have really been performing for many years before their big break.</div>

I prototyped extensively before coming up with the final version of
OpenPoker and tried Delphi, Python, C#, C/C and Scheme. I also wrote a
full-blown poker engine in Common Lisp. While I did spend over 9 months
on research and prototyping, the final rewrite only took about 6 weeks
of coding. I attribute most of the time and cost savings to choosing
Erlang as my platform.</div>

In a similar experiment, subjects were asked the last two digits of
their social security number and then asked what they would be willing
to pay for a consumer product (e.g., bottle of wine, wireless computer
keyboard, video game). Similarly, the price customers were willing to
pay was positively correlated with the (random) digits of the
customers’ social security number. For example, subjects with social
security numbers in the bottom 20% priced a bottle of Cotes du Rhone
wine at $8.64 versus subjects with social security numbers in the top
20% who priced the same bottle at $27.91.</div>

Because all of the mathematical results of network theory apply to
certain specialized and idealized mechanical systems, as well as to
certain specialized and idealized electrical systems, we can say that
in a sense network theory is *more* general than Maxwell's equations,
which do not apply to mechanical systems at all. In another sense, of
course, Maxwell's equations are more general than network theory, for
Maxwell's equations apply to all electrical systems, not merely to a
specialized and idealized class of electrical circuits.<br>
<br>
To some degree we must simply admit that this is so, without being able
to explain the fact fully. Yet we can say this much. Some theories are
strongly *physical* theories. Newton's laws and Maxwell's equations are
such theories. Newton's laws deal with mechanical phenomena; Maxwell's
equations deal with electrical phenomena. Network theory is essentially
a mathematical theory. The terms used in it can be given various
physical meanings. The theory has interesting things to say about
different physical phenomena, about mechanical as well as electrical
vibrations.<br>
<br>
Often a mathematical theory is the offshoot of a physical theory or of
physical theories. It can be an elegant mathematical formulation and
treatment of certain aspects of a general physical theory. Network
theory is a treatment of certain physical behavior common to electrical
and mechanical devices. A branch of mathematics called *potential
theory* treats problems common to electric, magnetic, and gravitational
fields and, indeed, in a degree to aerodynamics. Some theories seem,
however, to be more mathematical than physical in their very inception.</div>

Graphical models such as factor graphs allow a unified approach to a
number of key topics in coding and signal processing such as the
iterative decoding of turbo codes, LDPC codes and similar codes, joint
decoding, equalization, parameter estimation, hidden-Markov models,
Kalman filtering, and recursive least squares. Graphical models can
represent complex real-world systems, and such representations help to
derive practical detection/estimation algorithms in a wide area of
applications. Most known signal processing techniques -including
gradient methods, Kalman filtering, and particle methods -can be used
as components of such algorithms. Other than most of the previous
literature, we have used Forney-style factor graphs, which support
hierarchical modeling and are compatible with standard block diagrams.</div>

ABSTRACT<br>
<br>
Multitask Learning is an approach to inductive transfer that improves
generalization by using the domain information contained in the
training signals of related tasks as an inductive bias. It does this by
learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is
learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This
paper reviews prior work on MTL, presents new evidence that MTL in
backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of
supervisory signals, and presents new results for MTL with k-nearest
neighbor and kernel regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask
learning in three domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and
show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real
domains. We present an algorithm and results for multitask learning
with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression,
and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees.
Because multitask learning works, can be applied to many different
kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms,
we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on
real-world problems.</div>

Nonparametric Belief Propagation (NBP) is an inference algorithm for
graphical models containing continuous, non-Gaussian random variables.
NBP extends the popular class of particle filtering algorithms, which
assume variables are related by a Markov chain, to general graphs.
NBP's computations are based on efficient sampling algorithms which
avoid the need to discretize high-dimensional spaces. Currently, NBP
has been applied to several computer vision problems, but it also has
many potential applications in other fields.</div>

Abstract<br>
We consider the problem of learning Bayes Net<br>
structures for related tasks. We present an algo-<br>
rithm for learning Bayes Net structures that takes<br>
advantage of the similarity between tasks by bi-<br>
asing learning toward similar structures for each<br>
task. Heuristic search is used to ﬁnd a high scor-<br>
ing set of structures (one for each task), where the<br>
score for a set of structures is computed in a prin-<br>
cipled way. Experiments on problems generated<br>
from the ALARM and INSURANCE networks<br>
show that learning the structures for related tasks<br>
using the proposed method yields better results<br>
than learning the structures independently.</div>
