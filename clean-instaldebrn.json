In order to answer, Willow first needs to figure out what movies you like, so you give her a bunch of movies and tell her whether you liked each one or not (i.e., you give her a labeled training set). Then, when you ask her if she thinks you'll like movie X or not, she plays a 20 questions-like game with IMDB, asking questions like \"Is X a romantic movie?\", \"Does Johnny Depp star in X?\", and so on. She asks more informative questions first (i.e., she maximizes the information gain of each question), and gives you a yes/no answer at the end.\n\nThus, Willow is a decision tree for your movie preferences.\n\nBut Willow is only human, so she doesn't always generalize your preferences very well (i.e., she overfits). In order to get more accurate recommendations, you'd like to ask a bunch of your friends, and watch movie X if most of them say they think you'll like it. That is, instead of asking only Willow, you want to ask Woody, Apple, and Cartman as well, and they vote on whether you'll like a movie (i.e., you build an ensemble classifier, aka a forest in this case).\n\nNow you don't want each of your friends to do the same thing and give you the same answer, so you first give each of them slightly different data. After all, you're not absolutely sure of your preferences yourself -- you told Willow you loved Titanic, but maybe you were just happy that day because it was your birthday, so maybe some of your friends shouldn't use the fact that you liked Titanic in making their recommendations. Or maybe you told her you loved Cinderella, but actually you *really really* loved it, so some of your friends should give Cinderella more weight. So instead of giving your friends the same data you gave Willow, you give them slightly perturbed versions. You don't change your love/hate decisions, you just say you love/hate some movies a little more or less (you give each of your friends a bootstrapped version of your original training data). For example, whereas you told Willow that you liked Black Swan and Harry Potter and disliked Avatar, you tell Woody that you liked Black Swan so much you watched it twice, you disliked Avatar, and don't mention Harry Potter at all.\n\nBy using this ensemble, you hope that while each of your friends gives somewhat idiosyncratic recommendations (Willow thinks you like vampire movies more than you do, Woody thinks you like Pixar movies, and Cartman thinks you just hate everything), the errors get canceled out in the majority. Thus, your friends now form a bagged (bootstrap aggregated) forest of your movie preferences.\n\nThere's still one problem with your data, however. While you loved both Titanic and Inception, it wasn't because you like movies that star Leonardio DiCaprio. Maybe you liked both movies for other reasons. Thus, you don't want your friends to all base their recommendations on whether Leo is in a movie or not. So when each friend asks IMDB a question, only a random subset of the possible questions is allowed (i.e., when you're building a decision tree, at each node you use some randomness in selecting the attribute to split on, say by randomly selecting an attribute or by selecting an attribute from a random subset). This means your friends aren't allowed to ask whether Leonardo DiCaprio is in the movie whenever they want. So whereas previously you injected randomness at the data level, by perturbing your movie preferences slightly, now you're injecting randomness at the model level, by making your friends ask different questions at different times.\n\nAnd so your friends now form a random forest.\n"}]}

(This is not a new answer to the Homeric Question, but rather my attempt to give it back its question mark and its proper deep meaning.)[13] Homer contributed with his fixation, deliberately or unintentionally, to the destruction of his own tradition. Namely, not-to-be-fixed is the essence of tradition. The fixed plot and the fixed text of a poem do not exist in the tradition of heroic epic-making. The fixation appears only when the content and the plot of epic becomes firmly established and thus petrified, when it contains counter-traditional meaning and new or inverted-traditional themes and motifs, and when it is preserved in writing (in order to be non-traditionally learnt by heart and delivered in a non-traditional form of oral performance).[14]\n\nThe mythic-historic traditional poems of the siege of Troy and the tragic sacrifice of the substitute became, when “fixed,” the Iliad and the poem of Achilles’ anger.[15] The author of the Iliad deprived his creation of its traditional mythic-historic content and deep traditional meaning. On the other hand, the Iliad gained by its transformation: its volume, its poetic and many other values, and its productive strength.\n\n"},{"date":"2012-10-11T03:10:32.830Z","quote":"True","selection":"Neither the singer, nor his audience, knows exactly what will be the final product of his singing.

Studying Homer with all of this in mind gives us an insight into the beginnings and the origin of the Western essentially post-traditional and non-traditional culture.\n\nOur culture stands on feeble legs, as it has been built (and continues its progressive building) on post-traditional sand, not on tradition’s rich soil, which conservatively and wisely looks at progress as re-egress, and is nostalgically turned backwards, toward the idealized past when everything was necessarily better. Homer did a few things right, and many wrong, when he inverted and betrayed his tradition. At some point during the 8th century BC, a few post-traditional and professional poets, among them Homer and Hesiod, started to question their own heroic and religious tradition, and recognized their limits, as some important changes and ideas took hold in their life and in their society.  They have learned of other, much older non-Greek traditions, they traveled wherever they were welcome, and they became well acquainted with various Greek traditions. Some of these poets were very probably able to read and write (both in Greek and in other languages), and they have created their new individual style and ways of creation and performance, built on the imitation of inherited traditional heroic epic singing, and on the improvisation on its themes.\n\n"},{"date":"2013-11-24T17:21:22.805Z","quote":"True","selection":"the founders’ wrong equasion: oral = traditional, and in their exaggerated and passé notion of “abyss between oral and written.”"},{"date":"2013-11-26T00:08:51.621Z","quote":"True","selection":"a fundamental misunderstanding was introduced by Parry of what is tradition and traditional, and the relation to orality"},{"date":"2013-11-26T00:32:24.717Z","quote":"True","selection":"non-traditional epics, composed orally or in writing, and in a “traditional style” are the most common form of epics, present in many national literatures.[4] The hard task is to find bona fide traditional poems.

Their possessions were few, limited to what they could carry, though their technologies (given that limitation) were quite sophisticated. They had little or no private property, and social relationships were egalitarian, with no permanent inequality. Their population densities were quite low.\n\nEven as the Man the Hunter picture was coalescing, archaeologists and anthropologists recognized that some hunter-gatherers did not fit this picture. Chief among these were the Indians of the Northwest Coast of North America. These people, whose descendants still inhabit the region, lived in permanent towns of up to 1,000 people. They developed an elaborate and rich technology and one of the world's great artistic traditions, and they had I specialists such as wood-carvers, canoe-makers, and whalers, as well as permanent social classes comprising slaves, commoners, and a chiefly elite. They built fortresses and carried out warfare and long-distance trade. These traits were universally regarded by anthropologists as requiring agriculture. But the Northwest Coast was blessed with a rich environment, legendary for its once massive salmon runs. Environmental wealth, it was argued, had permitted these peoples to transcend their economy and develop a complex society otherwise impossible without agriculture. They were an anomaly, the exception that proved the rule. The discovery of complex hunter-gatherers happened during the 1970s, when archaeologists tried to apply the Man the Hunter model to modern and ancient cultures. They found that many such societies had more in common with the Northwest Coast peoples than with small, mobile groups. Among them were the Natufians in the Levant (13,400-10,500 B.C.), the Jomon in\n\nJapan (10,000-300 B.C.), and the Calusa in Florida (A.D. 800-1600).

As early as 1000 B.C., the Indians of western Oregon were burning extensive areas to encourage the growth of good deer forage and oak groves for acorns. Farther north, people burned to maintain berry patches. Women collected roots, weeding and tilling to increase productivity. This food was processed so it would keep, and storage facilities were needed to prevent it from being eaten by rodents, insects, or other vermin.\n\nFor the Natufians, subsistence included harvesting the wild forebears of wheat and collecting almonds, acorns, and other wild seeds and fruits. They may also have culled antelope herds, selecting particular animals to kill to maintain the health and quality of the herds. While it is extremely likely that Natufians stored grain, remains of storage facilities are rare. By ca. 9700 B.C., they began cultivating the progenitors of grains such as barley einkorn, and emmer wheat and established farming villages, making them the first people known to have domesticated plants."},{"date":"2013-11-05T16:39:50.357Z","quote":"True","selection":"The Calusa hunted land mammals, but fishing in shallow bays and estuaries was the foundation of their economy.

For the English Civil War, this usually means Oliver Cromwell and his Ironsides. This kind of history does narrate campaigns, but tends to treat them like moves in a board game, without paying much attention to logistics. Wanklyn is good on geography and makes vague allusions to ‘cavalry support’ being necessary on the march, but hasn’t really got to the bottom of how operations worked. The other view, associated with the War and Society school, is that battles are not important because wars are determined by economic resources. These two opinions also happen to coincide roughly with Whig and Marxist views of history. It might be going too far to say that there was a debate between them, because they’re more like two sets of unquestioned prejudices which casually dismiss each other.\"\n This pretty much sums up the different audiences I see on the Japanese history side of things"}]}

There are certainly sources of physical randomness that affect us all the time, e.g., brownian motion affecting which sperm fertilizes an ovum (asked this question on Physics StackExchange), and chaotic systems like the weather. These can introduce a single change which, since this world appears chaotic, snowballs and affects everything else. Then there are network sources of randomness, where (due to some initializing physical random event) one alternative gets slightly more support in the beginning and keeps building on that slight lead to swallow up all competitors. Other than in MusicLab experiments, where this latter social network randomness was very elegantly studied, we simply cannot imagine alternative worlds, and that's why we recoil against counterfactuals in history. If we had experiments allowing us to visualize or experience alternatives of physical randomness or just the stories resulting thereof, we would be more amenable to thinking about our current situations as fluid. EVE Online is potentially one testbed for such experimentation, but I don't yet know how to make it convincing."}]}

In one the first man makes love to a stalk of cane, yielding the human race. At religious ceremonies priests sipped sugar water from coconut shells, a beverage since replaced in sacred ceremonies with cans of Coke.\n\nSugar spread slowly from island to island, finally reaching the Asian mainland around 1000 B.C. By A.D. 500 it was being processed into a powder in India and used as a medicine for headaches, stomach flutters, impotence. For years sugar refinement remained a secret science, passed master to apprentice. By 600 the art had spread to Persia, where rulers entertained guests with a plethora of sweets. When Arab armies conquered the region, they carried away the knowledge and love of sugar. It was like throwing paint at a fan: first here, then there, sugar turning up wherever Allah was worshipped. “Wherever they went, the Arabs brought with them sugar, the product and the technology of its production,” writes Sidney Mintz in Sweetness and Power. “Sugar, we are told, followed the Koran.”\n\n"}]}

Nearly 80 percent of the air you are breathing right now is composed of the stuff. Yet for most of their lives, plants are probing the soil for every scrap of nitrogen they can get their root hairs on, and they often have a hard time finding enough. They desperately need nitrogen to make protein. Plant proteins are the ultimate source of all the proteins in you, so getting nitrogen out of the air and into plants is obviously very important to all of us.\n\nBut the two atoms in nitrogen gas are joined by triple bonds, so prying them apart requires lots of energy. Scads of energy. Humans did not discover a way to do it until 1909, and it requires 500 degrees C and 300 atmospheres of pressure to get the job done.\n\nBut humans were late to the game by several billion years. Bacteria began fixing nitrogen soon after life evolved by lucking into one of the most important enzymes on earth: nitrogenase. Nitrogenase splits nitrogen gas into its pieces and reincorporates the nitrogen atoms into ammonia. Plants can easily use ammonia to make protein.\n\nBut nitrogenase is quirky. While it requires lots of energy to do its job, it cannot tolerate oxygen, the usual source of the power to do it. Scientists call this quandry the “oxygen dilemma of nitrogen fixation.” Plants and microbes would presumably call it a bummer.\n\nBut some of them have evolved their way out of this dilemma. One group of free-living bacteria – the blue-green algae – stuff their nitrogenase into a special swollen, fortified cells that serve as anti-oxygen chambers. Another solution arose from a cooperative agreement between plants called legumes (like beans or peas) and root-dwelling bacteria called Rhizobia. In this case, the plant provides both the power for nitrogenase and protection from oxygen. Instead of hiding nitrogenase in an oxygen-free cell, legumes make an enzyme that mops up any oxygen that gets too close to nitrogenase.\n\nFrankia has taken a best-of-both-worlds approach. Like blue-green algae, it builds thick-walled spherical or club-shaped anti-oxygen chambers at the ends of some of its filaments. Unlike blue-green algae, at some point starting about 100 million years ago, it began to crawl inside the roots of certain woody trees and shrubs. There, it sponges the energy to run nitrogenase in return for a providing a cut of the goods.\n\n"}]}

Others are closely related to digestive enzymes\n\nHow does an enzyme end up as a venom? There are a number of ways. A common type of mutation causes DNA to get duplicated. At first, the duplication just means that twice as much of the original protein gets made. But then the extra gene can mutate again without harming the function of the original one. A mutation can, for example, change the signal a gene gets about where it should make its protein. Instead of becoming active in the pancreas, for example, it might start making proteins in the mouth.\n\nWhen an animal bites its prey, the enzyme can then get into the wound.

Like their eighteenth-century brethren, nineteenth-century Freemasons continued to champion Masonry’s ideology of openness, but in practice the brotherhood abandoned, to a great degree, its cosmopolitan and radical pasts. Reacting against Freemasonry’s elasticity during the previous century, grand lodge officials fought and won a struggle to gain control over the brotherhood by consciously identifying the brotherhood with loyalty to the state.

Elevations are usually from 300 to 1,150 feet but can reach as high as 1,300 feet; local relief varies from 50 to 650 feet.\nThe region was formed when Triassic conglomerates and reddish sandstone was intruded by Triassic and Jurassic diabase along a set of linear dikes and sills, which heated the sediments and turned them into denser, hard and less porous material - an example of which is Cemetery Ridge at Gettysburg. Because Triassic diabase has more open joints than shales or sandstones, it yields more water and the groundwater from diabase tends to be softer than those from wells in shale or sandstone.\nShallow, fine-textured and alkaline clayey soils formed over the diabase. These are more difficult to till and consequently are most often used for pasture or forest (Appalachian Oak). Acid-loving plants are absent on soils derived from diabase intrusions, resulting in distinctive regional flora. Woodland remains common, especially on steeper surfaces or areas covered by rocks and boulders. Where diabase is not an issue, the land is more suitable to agriculture."}]}

We want to adopt older usages of something, like words, in order to help us think better about something new, like software, that didn’t exist back when we’re returning to.\n\nCentral point of this talk: being able to think about whether some software is braided together, folded together.\n\nWhy would simple and easy ever be interchangeable. To me, Maxwell’s equations are simple. But they’re not easy to apply and use.\n\n“Easy” ~ “lie near”. The opposite of easy, “dangerous sense” (a la C.S. Lewis), is “hard” which has nothing to do with being far away. (“Hard” would imply “strong”.)\n\n“One braid” is about interleaving, folding, in terms of objective: *not* cardinality, not number, not e.g., “one operation”.\n\nEasy as near physical; and preexisting notion, familiarity. We’re fixated on this? There’s a third slant: within one’s capability, which is very uncomfortable for most to talk about.\n\nWhen I say “I like this technology, it’s simple”, I mean “easy.”\n\nSome very harsh things said in “Contstruct vs Artifact” slide. As programmers, we make constructs, the code we write, but what we deliver to our users are artifacts—they run the code, they don’t look at it. Yet we’re apparently very focused on the experience of the use of construct, e.g., programmer convenience, e.g., no semicolons, which don’t matter to the user. And this badness is compounded because our employers share our infatuation to the construct: if there’s a second programmer to whom your code is “easy”, familiar, in that the language and tools are familiar with them, then you’re replaceable. Caring about the artifact would apparently imply correctness, quality, maintenance, performance. The employer doesn’t care, he explicitly says, about the third aspect of “easy”, i.e., whether your code is easy for someone to *understand*, they just care about getting a replacement programmer into your seat and commanding them to type. I can’t believe he just slammed business owners in general like that.\n\nWe must base our assessment of constructs based on artifacts, not on the experience of using the construct, of typing it in.\n\n- Reliable things require us to understand them.\n- Intertwined things must be considered together.\n- Complexity undermines understanding.\n\nWhat’s true about all bugs? They got written :P, but no: they compiled and the passed tests. Very funny delivery of his “guardrail programming” notion of being able to change things because the tests will tell me if I break something. (Or, how to change code without thinking: use tests?)\n\nVery interesting chart that illustrates the notion that if you focus on easy, you will be able to move fast in the beginning but you’ll stop moving at all soon. If you focus on simple, you’ll start slow and speed up.\n\nWorst: easy and complex. The user doesn’t look at out software (code) and *doesn’t care how good a time we had when writing it.*\n\nKnitted castle versus Lego castle: changing them.\n\nIt’s in our hands: we install (change location), we learn. But we can’t get smarter :(). Another surprising shocking thing. And it’s not like some super-smart person can do all these great things because it’s juggling: juggling skill is thin-tailed, average juggler can do three, the best can maybe do twelve; none can do a thousand. We are *all* bad at understanding complex things.\n\nCL/Scheme DO braid parens: overloaded for calls, grouping, data structs.\n\nWe look for benefits, as programmers, without ever asking for the cost.\n\n“complect” is an archaic word but we can use it of course.\n\nVery interesting diagram of knots: you start with four cords and you end with a complex knot. The underlying material is the same! You’re doing this all the time: you can write the same program multiple ways and in some ways, you see the four cords right away because they’re not intertwined, they haven’t been complected. You use a different language or system or construct and suddenly you get a braided knot.\n\nComplect braid simple things together. Compose place them together. Modularity is *not* the key: you can write all kinds of software that are modular: “they might not call each other but they are completely—complected!” Partitioning and stratification (code organization) can be done by complex or simple.\n\nState complects value and time: you can’t get a value independent of time if at all. State is easy though—this complexity is so easy. Methods and modules or encapsulation don’t hide it. State is when you call a function or method with the same arguments and get a different result out: “it’s like poison”.\n\nRich Hickey is very angry in this talk.\n\nHe has a very interesting slide around 44min that talks about the simplicity toolkit and how to get them in whatever language you’re using. “Data. Please. We’re programmers. We’re supposed to write data processing programs. There’s so many programs that don’t have any data in them.” “There are maps, there are sets, there are linear sequential things.” Apparently polmorphism a la carte are amazing. Look into Clojure protocols.\n\nRules (Prolog) are better than conditionals. Declarative logic. Paraph.: please, start using maps and sets now, don’t feel like you have to write a class because you have a new piece of information. Artifacts, not authoring.\n\nSimplifying isn’t about counting! You might get more things, more threads hanging straight down, than fewer threads all entertwined. “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication” (LdV).\n"},{"date":"2013-07-01T18:41:50.884Z","quote":"False","selection":"I just slammed into this idea that list comprehensions aren't simple, they're compound: debugging why `[some expression for x in range(3)]` was wrongly building a list of arrays instead of scalars is much easier if you replace the list comprehension with a map.

The nature of malloc is that it has a long linked list of available blocks of memory called the free chain. When you call malloc, it walks the linked list looking for a block of memory that is big enough for your request. Then it cuts that block into two blocks -- one the size you asked for, the other with the extra bytes, and gives you the block you asked for, and puts the leftover block (if any) back into the linked list. When you call free, it adds the block you freed onto the free chain. Eventually, the free chain gets chopped up into little pieces and you ask for a big piece and there are no big pieces available the size you want. So malloc calls a timeout and starts rummaging around the free chain, sorting things out, and merging adjacent small free blocks into larger blocks. This takes 3 1/2 days. The end result of all this mess is that the performance characteristic of malloc is that it's never very fast (it always walks the free chain), and sometimes, unpredictably, it's shockingly slow while it cleans up. (This is, incidentally, the same performance characteristic of garbage collected systems, surprise surprise, so all the claims people make about how garbage collection imposes a performance penalty are not entirely true, since typical malloc implementations had the same kind of performance penalty, albeit milder.)"}]}

Clearly there are a variety of answers. With minimal capital, an innovator might build a prototype by hand in his or her garage on weekends, then use it to get a single customer to order ten units, for which production could be outsourced. Initial growth of the business would be slow, but over time profits from each stage could fund the next stage. Alternatively, a big company or venture fund might pour a large amount of money into the same idea, helping it to grow more quickly. It might build a factory and begin aggressive marketing, spending tens of millions of dollars before the first dollar of revenue is generated.\r\n\r\nNow suppose a quant comes in and models the process to determine an optimal schedule to supply capital to this business. Too little capital guarantees failure because at each stage the business must succeed in order to generate capital for the next stage. An unbroken run of successes is virtually impossible, even if you start with a great idea. The business needs to be able to survive setbacks, and possibly to run at a loss for a period, both of which require capital. However some businesses with inadequate capital will have substantial runs of success. These will be flashes in the pan, overnight sensations followed by spectacular busts.\r\n\r\nToo much capital can insulate a business from the selection pressure needed to evolve and, in any event, will be wasted. So in principle—and I believe in practice—it is possible for a quant to come up with an optimal schedule for supplying capital to a business venture.\r\n\r\nThe government has a different perspective on the problem. It doesn’t like companies failing and leaving unpaid liabilities. It might decide business ideas must be funded by a minimum amount of capital so that suppliers and employees (not to mention taxes) are paid in full if the idea doesn’t work. We could imagine regulators seizing on the calculations done by quants, and insisting businesses have equity capital at least equal to the optimal level"},{"date":"2013-05-31T20:49:01.752Z","quote":"True","selection":"Before going any farther, note that the government concern is legitimate, although largely self-created.

It makes your code nice and readable with stuff like _.isString(), and _.isArray(). I'm not really sure how you could write safe code otherwise. Also, for enhanced command-line-fu, check out my own Underscore-CLI.\nAsync Pattern Modules:\n\nStep - very elegant way to express combinations of serial and parallel actions. My personal reccomendation. See my post on what Step code looks like.\nFutures - much more flexible (is that really a good thing?) way to express ordering through requirements. Can express things like \"start a, b, c in parallel. when A, and B finish, start AB. when A, and C finish, start AC.\" Such flexibility requires more care to avoid bugs in your workflow (like never calling the callback, or calling it multiple times). See Raynos's post on using futures (this is the post that made me \"get\" futures).\nAsync - more traditional library with one method for each pattern. I started with this before my religious conversion to step and subsequent realization that all patterns in Async could be expressed in Step with a single more readable paradigm.\nTameJS - Written by OKCupid, it's a precompiler that adds a new language primative \"await\" for elegantly writing serial and parallel workflows.

It would be the subject of a 15- or 20-page paper, which could be read and understood in a few hours or perhaps days by members of the subfield.\n\nWhy is there such a big expansion from the informal discussion to the talk to the paper? One-on-one, people use wide channels of communication that go far beyond formal mathematical language. They use gestures, they draw pictures and diagrams, they make sound effects and use body language. Communication is more likely to be two-way, so that people can concentrate on what needs the most attention. With these channels of communication, they are in a much better position to convey what's going on, not just in their logical and linguistic facilities, but in their other mental facilities as well.\n\nIn talks, people are more inhibited and more formal. Mathematical audiences are often not very good at asking the questions that are on most people's minds, and speakers often have an unrealistic preset outline that inhibits them from addressing questions even when they are asked.\n\nIn papers, people are still more formal.

In most applications, interactions between code and the outside world can be narrowed down to couple of critical moments. Even in something as complex as a game, you really just need a few bytes representing user input at the start of a frame, then much later you have a list of things to draw and a list of sounds to start, and those get handed off to a thin, external driver of sorts, the small part of the application that does the messy hardware interfacing. \n\nThe rest of the code can live in isolation, doing arbitrarily complex tasks like laying out web pages and mixing guitar tracks.

A simple option is to group related files into colored boxes, much like folders, except you can see the contents the whole time. With the narrow, vertical format out of the way, there can be multiple columns of boxes filling the space. Now you can see 100+ files at a time instead of a dozen. \n\nIt might make more sense to display modules as shapes, each connected by lines to the modules which are imported. Or provide multiple visualizations of the project, each for a different purpose. \n\nSomeone, sometime, and probably not all that long ago, came up with the canonical \"project view on the left side of the window\" design for IDEs. And you may wonder how that person arrived at that solution. After all, there were no prior IDEs to use for guidance. I think the answer is a basic one: because it's a solution that worked and was better than what came before. No magic. No in-depth comparison of a dozen possibilities. Clearly a way to see all the files in a project is better than a raw window in a text editor where there's no concept of \"project\" whatsoever. That solution wasn't the best solution that could ever exist in the entire future history of IDEs, but it sure fooled people into thinking it was. \n\nIf you want to think like a pioneer, focus on the problem you're trying to solve. The actual problem. Don't jump directly to what everyone else is doing and then rephrase your problem in terms of that solution.

Now suppose you've got two very memory intensive algorithms in your code, and each independently pushes the limits of available RAM. The question is, can you guarantee that first algorithm won't be lazily delayed until it is forced to run right in the middle of the second algorithm, completely blowing the memory limit? \n\nThe GHC developers know that laziness can be expensive (or at least unnecessary in many cases), so strictness analysis is done to try to convert lazy code to non-lazy code. If and when that's successful, wonderful! Maybe some programs that would have previously blown-up now won't. But this only works in some cases, so as a Haskell coder you've got to worry about the cases where it doesn't happen. As much as I admire the Haskell language and the GHC implementation, I find it difficult to form a solid mental model of how Haskell code is executed, partially because that model can change drastically depending on what the compiler does.

This mind-set is not universally or firmly held by people in general.  It must be acquired through experience (much of it negative, painful and expensive) or through education, or through a combination of both.  The attitudes that make up this mind-set are as follow:\n\n“Every person is capable of committing a crime against me.” No one is perfect, and each one is a potential threat to some degree (large or small).\n“Some normally law-abiding people, under the right set of circumstances, will commit crimes that are out of character for themselves.”   People are usually unprepared when normally law-abiding people commit crimes against them.  Preparation begins with accepting this attitude.\n“Some people are committed to a lifestyle of lawlessness and crime.”  These people commit crimes way out of proportion to their small numbers in the population.  These people don’t seem to hold the same moral/ethical values that the majority in society hold.  \n“Some people are capable of and willing to commit heinous acts of violence.” Most people are not capable of such acts of violence and have trouble imagining how brutal and cruel other people can be.  Since they can’t imagine the violence, they won’t prepare to defend against it.\n“There is a reasonable chance I could be the victim of a crime in my home.”  Obviously, people who are convinced they live in such a safe place that they could never be the victim of a crime in their home will not take precautions to prevent such a crime. Even people who realize there is crime all around them will not take precautions if they believe the statistical probability of them being victimized is nearly zero.\n“There are precautions I can afford and practically implement that will prevent my being victimized or significantly elevate my ability to respond to minimize my losses and injuries.”  Without this attitude, people may be well aware of their risk of being victimized in their home but at the same time remain passive and inactive.  People have to see actions they themselves can realistically take that will significantly reduce their exposure to criminal danger.  \n“Preparation and prevention are far more effective at keeping people safe than spontaneously reacting to a criminal attack after it has started.”\n"}]}

It is illegible if it serves many functions and purposes in complex ways, such that no single participant can easily comprehend the whole. The terms were coined by James Scott in Seeing Like a State.

He wrote to a\nfriend stating Datong to be his political goal, while citing the Confucian\nevolutionist paradigm developed by Kang. Understandably, that has been\nsuppressed throughout his career, probably because of his insistence on\nhis originality, but apparently also due to an urge to hide his original\ncalling’s Confucian underpinning in the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary rat\nrace, in both his theoretical one-upman-ship within the party, and later\nin his state-building rivalry with the Soviet Union.

New social history is also characterized by using new materials for research. Unlike traditional Chinese historiography whose primary sources are mainly from officially compiled historical books and documents, social historians also use oral history, folk literature, and materials from field investigation as primary sources for their research. Their new theory and methodology encourages an inter-disciplinary framework and the borrowing of conceptions and methodologies from anthropology, sociology, psychology, and related academic fields.2 Social historians also emphasize the significance of studying history from the perspective of the people being studied. For example, to study women, one should examine their behavior from the point of view of women not of men.\"\n\n\"To these scholars the rise of women's history is not in conflict with traditional historiography, but just adds a new subject to it. Other scholars argue that the rise of women's history and gender studies is a revolution in the methodology of historical studies because it not only introduces a new subject but demands a review or re-thinking of the whole history of China from the perspective of women. Since this new perspective places women at the center of historical analysis, it forces a critical re-examination of all the assumptions and conclusions historians had made before they integrated women into their scholarly works.\""}]}

Have you heard of the expression “playing ‘possum?” These cuties will actually slip into a comatose state, with their mouths open, drooling and everything, to appear dead. They will even emit a foul smell from their anal gland and their heart and breathing rates drop. It’s quite convincing and many predators, such as foxes and bobcats, will leave them be.\nAfter all of this, I think the most interesting thing about Virginia opossums is their mating and reproduction. They are the only marsupial found in the United States. The male opossum courts a female by clicking its teeth and following her around. At some point the female accepts his appeals and he mounts her in a typical mammalian fashion. Then they will fall to their right side. Yes, almost always to their right side. If they stay upright, or if they fall to their left side, then the female is not likely to be inseminated. The opossum penis is forked, which is probably why people used to believe that male opossums would inseminate the females through their noses and that the females would then sneeze their babies into their pouches. Yes. People really believed that. Their sperm are also paired and can only swim properly in pairs. If you separate a pair of sperm, then each sperm just swims in circles. I could not make this shit up.\nAlright, the male is now done and everything else is up to the female. Like all marsupials, she has a pouch and the incredibly tiny young are born shortly after fertilization and climb into her pouch. However, for opossums its not quite so easy. Up to 25 small opossums are born. They are all so tiny that you could fit all of them together in a teaspoon.  And they will all race to mom’s pouch, because in an extreme case of survival of the fittest (not the Darwinian definition of fitness, but in terms of physical strength and endurance) only 13 will be able to attach to a nipple. (In “North American Wildlife” by David Jones, he calls it the “world’s cruelest game of musical chairs.”) That’s right mom only has 13 nipples and once a young opossum attaches to a nipple, it swells up and they are essentially locked on until they are developed enough to leave the pouch (about 2 months). The rest of the babies, if they even make it into the pouch, just die. While we’re on the topic, the Virginia opossum is one of the few mammals that has an odd number of nipples. She has 12 nipples in a circle, and then one right in the middle. They are truly unusual mammals.\n"}]}

I view every modern work of professional history with as much suspicion as Victorian or Leninist/Stalinist history (viz., Soviet archaeology holding the Russian state to be immune from non-Slavic incursions of blood or ideas since time immemorial). Our modern ideologies are just harder for us to see. The vain desire to stand outside of one's society and oneself to reflect on the past is as pervasive as the problems of academic history.\n\nThe Goths and Huns encountering Roman wealth no doubt had much to envy, just as the steppe people envied the Chinese manufacted finery.\n\nAny major institution exists in a complex balance of power and control; one can even say it is defined by such a web of alliances and contentions. The Huns were a black swan that upset many or most of those balanced polarities. Such an unbalancing can rewrite the nature of any institution defined by the original web.\n\nWhite traders or prisoners who lived with the native American peoples in ten years often look like them. *Look.* How much of what passes for race is techno-cultural?\n\nThese Romans (in the fifth century?) in times of crisis (as the Huns definitely caused) would grant titles to non-Roman peoples to rule lands in the Roman name (\"feudal\" or in today's parlance, semi-autonomous) but they would also hand out sovereignty out-right, and concomitantly forge alliances with the new de facto independent states. \"Delegated itself out of existence\". This is very rare today, and goes back to the idea I've been thinking a lot about: you don't own your land, you rent it from the state which can take it away and sell it to someone else if you don't pay your taxes; and there's no more land that you can go to to set up a new sovereign state without negotiating for that right with a state that's already there. Unless you went to very poor parts of the world? Can you buy a piece of Liberia or the Maldives from those states?\n\nChurch says: heretic < infidel.\n\nTacitus: \"It stands on record that armies already wavering and on the point of collapse have been rallied by the women, pleading heroically with their men, thrusting forward their bared bosoms, and making them realize the imminent prospect of enslavement - a fate which the Germans fear more desperately for their women than for themselves. Indeed, you can secure a surer hold on these nations if you compel them to include among a consignment of hostages some girls of noble family. More than this, they believe that there resides in women an element of holiness and a gift of prophecy; and so they do not scorn to ask their advice, or lightly disregard their replies. In the reign of the emperor Vespasian we saw Veleda long honoured by many Germans as a divinity; and even earlier they showed a similar reverence for Aurinia and a number of others - a reverence untainted by servile flattery or any presence of turning women into goddesses.\"\n\nThe decline in living standards in post-Roman Gaul and Britain (among others?) ought to be expected (predicting in the past being what it is) and has very obvious parallels today. When a society experiences any changes, skills and methods of earning livelihood (i.e., getting food, clothing, shelter) become misaligned from reality. When these post-Roman peoples ceased to be a part of a very urban and pluralistic empire, many service-providers and manufacturers were out of business and not earning livelihoods because they couldn't get inputs to their business, or there were no markets or ways to get outputs to markets, etc. A deurbanizing people has to rediscover agriculture and farming. The very complex skills of herding, gathering, and farming will take potentially generations to relearn. Mongolians who felt that herding was in their blood have found it very hard to make a living with it after they attempted to return to it after the withdrawal of the Russians after a hundred years of domination. No longer were Mongolian factories supplied by the Soviet empire and no longer could Mongolian products compete in markets they could access, and on top of that, the Mongolian people rediscovered this notion that herding and farming is terrifically complicated and requires much skill, experience, and lore. No doubt Cuba went through something related when it adjusted to a low-oil society.\n\nIf a tree falls in a forest and nobody is around to see it... If two barbarian peoples go to war and there was nobody around to memorialize it in some fixed medium such as writing... (it would have been sung about, no doubt, and incorporated into the national heroic lays, but they don't last unmixed).\n\nJust as many barbarian warrior kings are just as henpecked and bullied by strong women (wives, mothers, sisters, daughters) as men today. Yes, that includes Arab and Indian men, believe me... the veils and the separation of genders and theoretical subservience of womankind never changes the age-old fact that strong women will never be subservient to their men in private.\n\nPeople are always surprised when they see that Christianity, whose first martyrs showed their other cheek when struck on one and who wouldn't dream of killing their persecutors, was co-opted by warrior peoples like Constantine (in hoc signo vinces) and Clovis. Or that the Buddha, who was rebelling against a theology where deities controlled men's lives, was himself made the central deity of many of today's Buddhists; or that reincarnation, which he pooh-poohed as a distracting non-issue became a central aspect in most Buddhist traditions. There really isn't anything like *religious* authority versus *secular* authority, or the power of the *wealth*. There's just political power: the ability of few to demand taxes of the many in exchange for nominal governmental services like not stealing *all* your property and maybe trying to keep other tax-booters (I shouldn't say freeboothers) from taking much of your property either. Almost orthogonal to this dimension of human affairs is that of psychology and ethics and literature, the realm of ideas on self-conduct and of songs of others' conduct. I call the key discoveries and core proposals of later-deified religion-founder types (Jesus, Buddha, Confucius, etc., who very often couldn't tell at the end of their lives if they'd started anything remotely significant, since these examples were black swans, hugely successful saint-sage types, most of whom are, like writers, almost assuredly unsuccessful) as psychologies. They aren't religions, they're intelligent and practical theories which would probably earn them a PhD and at least a journal paper today. The religions that grow around these ideas are by my definition related to political power and the ability to tax people. Religion is an example of political power that grows out of the discoveries of psychological algorithms. (Over the last couple of hundred years, definitely since the poorly-named Enlightenment, methods of political control that grew around techno-mythical theories like Marxism or capitalism or scientism---science as thought about by non-science-math-types---have dominated our societies, causing much more suffering and death than religion-based or classic I-have-a-big-army-so-pay-up political power.) Methods of gaining and maintaining the power (to tax) that grow around psychological or social ideas will very likely propagate not the original theory but some altered version of it, changed if just in order to make it work. You don't expect a Matlab script to run on an airborne embedded processor, or a cluster; the implementation and even the basic algorithm might need to change to take properly take advantage of the target platform. Jesus and Confucius and the Buddha can maybe be analogized as R&D PhDs coding their breakthrough algorithms in Matlab and Python. Constantine and Ashoka and the Spring and Autumn emperors were the folks who look at the code they're handed, shake their heads, throw it away and rewrite it from scratch for a PIC processor or a Hadoop cluster. It's unreasonable to expect that the psychologies propounded by later-deified-as-religion-founders thinkers would survive intact their incorporation into a system of political control."}]}

When we allow our country into a war, we have to assume that civilian horrors will ensue.

I was unable to respond to all of this e-mail without its having a detrimental effect on my work, and so I posted a Web page explaining that I did not have time to answer all of my e-mail. To my astonishment, this actually increased the amount of e-mail that I received. All of it began with some variation on the phrase ``I have read your Web page explaining why you don't answer unsolicited e-mail, but I think you'll make an exception in my case because...'' Consequently, I had to post another web page reiterating what the first one had said, somewhat more forcefully. \nNot long after, I saw myself referred to somewhere as \"reclusive.\"\nNow, since I live in a crowded neighborhood in a populous city and socialize with people every day, and frequently take part in parties, dinners, etc., I found it very strange that I should be characterized in this way. I do like to have a fair bit of time to myself each day, so that I can get work done. But outside of that, I am quite sociable. If anything, I am one of the least reclusive persons I know. Clearly, the person who had tagged me as ``reclusive'' was responding to my Web page in which I explained why I could not respond to unsolicited e-mail. \nFor a while it was difficult for me to understand how this could be confused with reclusivity. Then I had a sort of epiphany, as follows. I walked into a friend's house where a television set happened to be on. It was tuned to one of the all-news channels such as CNN, MSNBC, or FOX (there is no point in my specifying which network exactly). This occurred during the build-up to George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq. Beyond that story, of course, much else was going on: a nuclear standoff in North Korea, global climate change, the hunt for Osama bin Laden, and countless other stories that ought to be covered by the all-news channels but are ignored. The particular news item that filled the screen when I entered the room was that today was the fifty-third birthday of Richard Dean Anderson.\nFor those of you who are reading this in the distant future, I should explain that there once was a broadcast medium called television, and on it appeared serialized dramas called TV shows, and one of those shows was called MacGyver; by this point (early 2003) it had been defunct for some years, however Richard Dean Anderson had been its lead actor, and the fact of his reaching 53 years of age was deemed worthy of a few moments' screen time by this particular all-news channel.\nThis is not to be read as criticism of Mr. Anderson. If he saw this news item on the TV, he was probably as taken aback as I was. Rather, it is to make a point about how our culture assigns priorities to current events. A society in which news about an impending war is interrupted to announce the birthday of an actor, will categorize as reclusive a man, of a normal level of sociability, who posts a Web page explaining why he does not have sufficient time to answer all of his unsolicited e-mail.\n"}]}

While I do not consider myself a recluse, I have found it necessary to place some limits on my direct interactions with individual readers. These limits most often come into play when people send me letters or e-mail, and also when I am invited to speak publicly. This document is a sort of form letter explaining why I am the way I am.\nWhen I read a novel that I really like, I feel as if I am in direct, personal communication with the author. I feel as if the author and I are on the same wavelength mentally, that we have a lot in common with each other, and that we could have an interesting conversation, or even a friendship, if the circumstances permitted it. When the novel comes to an end, I feel a certain letdown, a loss of contact. It is natural to want to recapture that feeling by reading other works by the same author, or by corresponding with him/her directly.\nAll of this seems perfectly reasonable---I should know, since I have had these feelings myself! But it turns out to be a bad idea. To begin with, a novel has roughly the same relationship to a conversation with the author, as a movie does to the actors in it. A movie represents many person-years of work distilled into two hours, and so everything sounds and looks perfect. But if you have ever met a movie actor in person, you know that they are not quite as dazzling and witty (or as tall) as the figures they play in movies. This seems obvious but it always comes as a bit of a letdown anyway.\nLikewise, a novel represents years of hard work distilled into a few hundred pages, with all (or at least most) of the bad ideas cut out and thrown away, and the good ideas polished and refined as much as possible. Interacting with an author in person is nothing like reading his novels. Just about everyone who gets an opportunity to meet with an author in person ends up feeling mildly let down, and in some cases, grievously disappointed.\nAuthors are participants in a kind of colloquy that joins together all literate persons, and so it seems only reasonable that they should from time to time stop writing fiction for a few hours or days, and attend public events, such as conventions, signings, panels, seminars, etc., where they should exchange ideas with other authors and with other members of society. Therefore, authors such as myself frequently receive invitations to do exactly that.\nLetters or e-mail from readers, and invitations to speak in public, might seem like very different things. In fact they are points on a common continuum; they have more in common than is obvious at first. The e-mail message from the reader, and the invitation to speak at a conference, are both requests (in most cases, polite and absolutely reasonable requests) for the author to interact directly with readers.\nNormally, my only interaction with readers is to go to a Fedex drop box every couple of years and throw in the manuscript of a completed novel. It seems reasonable enough to ask for a little bit more than that! After all, the time commitment is very small: a few minutes tapping out an e-mail message, or a day trip to a conference to speak.\nFor some authors, this works, but in my case, it doesn't. There is little to nothing that I can offer readers above and beyond what appears in my published writings. It follows that I should devote all my efforts to writing more material for publication, rather than spending a few minutes here, a day there, answering e-mails or going to conferences.\nWriting novels is hard, and requires vast, unbroken slabs of time. Four quiet hours is a resource that I can put to good use. Two slabs of time, each two hours long, might add up to the same four hours, but are not nearly as productive as an unbroken four. If I know that I am going to be interrupted, I can't concentrate, and if I suspect that I might be interrupted, I can't do anything at all. Likewise, several consecutive days with four-hour time-slabs in them give me a stretch of time in which I can write a decent book chapter, but the same number of hours spread out across a few weeks, with interruptions in between them, are nearly useless.\nThe productivity equation is a non-linear one, in other words. This accounts for why I am a bad correspondent and why I very rarely accept speaking engagements. If I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. But as those chunks get separated and fragmented, my productivity as a novelist drops spectacularly. What replaces it? Instead of a novel that will be around for a long time, and that will, with luck, be read by many people, there is a bunch of e-mail messages that I have sent out to individual persons, and a few speeches given at various conferences.\nThat is not such a terrible outcome, but neither is it an especially good outcome. The quality of my e-mails and public speaking is, in my view, nowhere near that of my novels. So for me it comes down to the following choice: I can distribute material of bad-to-mediocre quality to a small number of people, or I can distribute material of higher quality to more people. But I can't do both; the first one obliterates the second.\nAnother factor in this choice is that writing fiction every day seems to be an essential component in my sustaining good mental health. If I get blocked from writing fiction, I rapidly become depressed, and extremely unpleasant to be around. As long as I keep writing it, though, I am fit to be around other people. So all of the incentives point in the direction of devoting all available hours to fiction writing.\nI am not proud of the fact that some of my e-mail goes unanswered as a result. It is never my intention to be rude or to give well-meaning readers the cold shoulder. If I were a commercial best-seller, I would have enough money to hire a staff to look after my correspondence. As it is, my books are bought by enough people to provide me with a sort of middle-class lifestyle, but not enough to hire employees, and so I am faced with a stark choice between being a bad correspondent and being a good novelist. I am trying to be a good novelist, and hoping that people will forgive me for being a bad correspondent.\n--nts\n"}]}

The problem, in my view, is that the present bubble is systemic – with short-term interest rates at zero, the prospective returns of nearly every asset class, looking out over a 5-7 year horizon, is also close to zero. Equity investors, in particular, don’t see it because part of this bubble is captured in profit margins rather than in prices "}]}

Whatever their cause, the fires were certainly dramatic, racing across the prairie at speeds of up to 15 to 20 kilometers per hour and incinerating vast tracts. Forests were slow to recover from the destruction, but prairie grasses, whose seeds and buds remained cool a few inches below the scorched surface, were back the next year. Grasses, in short, thrived because they were better adapted to the stressful prairie environment than trees, surviving everything except civilization's appetite for arable land.\n"}]}

Suikoden was written in vernacular Chinese (hakuwa), which was unfamiliar to Japanese as they were traditionally educated in Classical Chinese(kanbun). Thus, the process developed as follows: original Chinese text → wakoku → kanbun kundoku (formal Japanese) →vernacular translation → adaptation → creative writing in Japanese. \n\nWakoku retained the original hakuwa text, while inserting marks in small print as a reading aid to indicate Japanese word order and inflections. Only a few translators, who had training in hakuwa were capable of wakoku. Kanbun kundoku changed the word order while retaining a large part of the original vocabulary. The vernacular translation replaced Chinese with more familiar Japanese words. At each stage Suikoden lost some of its Chinese elements and gained more Japanese characteristics.\n\nSimilarly, early adaptations were often direct copies or parodies of the original, while later ones demonstrated a thorough reworking of the foreign elements to obscure their Chinese origins, and succeeded in creating their own world. At the same time, some hakuwa vocabulary as well as the particular style, shôkai shôsetsu (chapter novels based on story-telling), entered into Japanese literature and were inspirational sources for yomihon novels.\n\nThis paper examines each stage and explores a process of transformation from Chinese into Japanese that is unique to kanji culture.\n\n"}]}

By 1944 she had published twenty-six books – historical novels, short stories and legends – some of which underwent several editions. Historical topics played such an important role in her oeuvre because, as she once said:\n\n“‘the historical past, and the past of the Bulgarian people in particular, has always impressed my imagination with its interesting ways of life, not typical of our times, with its picturesque costumes and the peculiar colour of the epoch.20’\n\n“It is not by chance that she turned to history and mostly to the Bulgarian medieval past. To understand this we should imagine the social and political situation in Bulgaria after World War I. Bulgaria was among the defeated states that had been treated severely by the victors. The ideal of ‘national unification’, which had claimed so many victims and caused so much suffering, was destroyed. The humiliating defeat led to intellectual pessimism and worry about the future of the country.21 The atmosphere was fertile soil for the spread of leftist visions about society and for the discrediting of nationalist projects. The past became the only refuge for  a wounded national pride, and was a source of reassurance. As Georgi Nokov wrote in 1930:\n\n“‘No literary genre to date equals the success of her historical\nnovels, chronicles and novelettes. This is due to a large extent to\nthe despair and discouragement that the treaty of Neuille brought upon\nus, with its cruel provisions that aimed not only tohurt but even to\nkill our national consciousness.22’”\n\n“Fani Popova-Mutafova took the theme for this novel from The History of the Byzantine Empire by Charles Lebeaux, who wrote:\n\n“‘Boril did not have children and gave Henry the daughter of his predecessor Ioanikii (Kaloian) for a wife; thus the French saw the daughter of their biggest enemy become an empress of their empire, and for that reason some historians accused her of poisoning her husband Henry on 11 June 1216, because she harboured in her heart the hatred against the French that her father Ioanikii (Kaloian) taught her.24’\n\n“She turned this short, dry historical reference into a vivid and dramatic narration of a piece of Bulgarian history, with three main focuses:  the Bulgarian king Boril in Turnovo, Kaloian’s daughter Maria, and the (crusaders’) Latin empire and its emperor in Constantinople. The main message of the novel is to praise the patriotic feelings of the Bulgarian princess Maria, who sacrificed her love and life in the service of her people.”\n\n‘The heroic and patriotic pathos of her historical novels and stories combines perfectly with her erudition and systematic study of historical data and sources: Bulgarian, Byzantine and West European. She not only studied the available historical sources very carefully but draws in details of everyday life that make her novels read like a panorama of life in thirteenth-century Bulgaria and Byzantium. This passion for details, for the minutiae of everyday life, and the combination of the romantic and the realistic, made critics compare her works to those of Sir Walter Scott, not least because of the pleasure derived from reading them.’\n\n‘Patriotic as they are, Fani Popova-Mutafova’s historical epics are far from simple nationalism.’\n\n‘Although not a university-educated historian, Fani Popova-Mutafova was considered a professional historian by ordinary readers and academic scholars both before and after 1944.29 She immersed herself in the past and collected every single document, even if it only contained a few words about the time, people or places she was depicting. She investigated the historical facts included in her novels and tried to give them a proper interpretation, presenting them from various points of view. Fani Popova-Mutafova was a true social historian at a time when social history did  not exist as an academic field in Bulgaria, and she made great efforts to reconstruct everyday life both of the elite and of common people in the thirteenth century.’\n\n‘as the well-known Bulgarian intellectuals Professor Stefan Mladenov and Kiril Hristov pointed out, Fani Popova-Mutafova was not content to place her heroes in the narrow frames of the Bulgarian, Balkan or even Latin-Byzantine history, but looked for a comparative European context.’\n\n‘The first current is the so-called narodo-psykhologia or folk psychology, inspired by the German Volkspsychologie, which essentialised ‘typical traits’ and ‘mentalities’ of the people. Bulgarians in the past, according to this vision, possessed many virtues: they were brave, courageous, strong and daring and at the same time trustful to the point of being naïve and credulous. These latter qualities were manipulated by the diabolical Other for the Bulgarians in the Middle Ages: the Byzantine empire. In fact, many Bulgarian male academic scholars (Professor Petur Mutafchiev is a case in point34) made a lot of the devastating role of ‘Byzantinism’ in Bulgarian medieval history.’\n\n‘The second major influence in her philosophy of Bulgarian history texts is eugenics. To make a clear distinction, she was an advocate of positive eugenics, that is, measures for promoting nativity and health, rather than negative eugenics (sterilisation, and other measures dear to the Nazis).’ — Fani is not a Nazi!!! the writer cries.\n\n‘Fani Popova-Mutafova warned that increasing involvement of women in the paid labour force would cause serious decline in fertility and natality. She linked the question of fertility to debates on population size and its relation to national strength.’ — And we have seen that industrializing countries correlate perfectly with declining birthrates. \n\n‘During the 1920s and 1930s the Bulgarian governments (following German examples) actually adopted several laws aimed at the improvement of the situation of women, but they were ineffective, as small-peasant Bulgaria could not emulate the western welfare state and its provisions.’\n\n‘“women who were driven by strong, hardly suppressed emotions”’\n\n“Those who had praised Bulgarian medieval history, especially the early epoch of the proto-Bulgarian khans before the establishment of the Bulgarian medieval state, and who had ‘underestimated’ the role of the Slav component in the formation of the Bulgarian nation, were considered ‘racists’”\n\n‘Ninety-eight people were sentenced alongside Fani Popova-Mutafova, fourteen to death.’ — So again we see that this great tragedy mainly affected very few people, partly explaining why the masses didn’t rise up against this minor oppression.\n\n“the annual report of GLAVLITfor 1955, which states: ‘it would be unjust to claim that all Fani Popova-Mutafova’s works are dangerous’.”\n\n‘intellectuals and authors like Popova-Mutafova continued to live in isolation, without prospects for a better future, unless they agreed to collaborate with the regime or at least stated publicly that they accepted Marxist ideology, and adopted ‘socialist realism’ as their literary style.’\n\n‘Expressing one’s ideas in Aesopian language was quite common in the East European literary process under communism.’\n\n‘Throughout her life Fani Popova-Mutafova believed that she was serving her people and her country.’ — God save us from these people.\n\n‘the situation of a defeated Bulgaria after World War I, with its thwarted national dreams and expectations’\n\n"}]}

Birkenmeier suggests that Anna’s knowledge of the classics caused her to write her account of Dristra in this way so that, despite the defeat, Alexios ‘would gain some amount of reflexive glory from the allusive comparison of his deeds with those of Valens, an emperor from a time of greater imperial power’.

If Kinnamos is correct, we can imagine the scene of the army commanders, relieved that they had weathered the Pecheneg storm, who were then ordered to attack the invulnerable wagon-fortress by an Emperor being treated for an arrow wound.

If the revelation has to be explained, it’s not a revelation.’\n\n‘Joseph Campbell’s definition of mythology. In his lecture entitled /Man and Myth/, Campbell starts his talk by saying that most people think of mythology as other people’s religion. He counters that religion is often misunderstood mythology. In Campbell’s view, any living mythology can be broken into four aspects: the mystical, the cosmological, the sociological, and the pedagogical.’\n\n‘Many times this sociological structure mirrors the cosmological one. People may rest on the same day the divinity rested. Rulers who are identified with celestial phenomenon may be buried alive when their cosmological counterparts cycle through the constellations. Still other cultures regard their ritual sacrifices as necessary for ensuring that the seasons will continue so that life can survive’\n\n‘Uchida Kenji. At the time, Mr. Uchida was working for Sunrise, a division of Bandai Entertainment. During his presentation at the symposium he said something very interesting: “In America, when you want to make something stronger than a human being, you make a superhero. In Japan, when you want to make something stronger than a human being, you make a giant robot.” Most of the audience chuckled at his comment but I was intrigued. My hand shot up. I asked him the reason for this difference. He answered that it was because America and Japan had different concepts of “god.” He went on to say that in America, God is anthropomorphized. The God of the Bible is thought of as a person, and we are “made in His image.” It would make sense then that an American superbeing would manifest itself in human form. In Japan, he said, the situation is quite different. There, the traditional concept of god comes from Shintō, the indigenous, animistic, and polytheistic religion of Japan. In Shintō, the concept of god or kami is much more malleable. The Sun, Mount Fuji, and other natural phenomenon are worshipped as kami. Ancestors are also venerated as kami. Until the last century, the Emperor was honored as kami. Kami can be thought of both personally, as in the case of ancestor worship, and impersonally, in the case of deifying natural phenomena. Uchida explained that in anime, the giant robot comes from this more protean and elemental notion of divine energy. Supernatural power can manifest itself in a mechanical form that may be humanoid in shape and may even demonstrate some human qualities, but it is certainly not human. It is the personification of a divine force that is elemental in nature.’\n\n‘“Megadeus” is a combination of the Greek word mega meaning “big” and the Latin word deus meaning “god.” The giant robot, Big O, is therefore a “Big God.” However, Big O is not the monotheistic god of the Abrahamic tradition. Big O is one god among many and is closer to the notion of Shintō kami. There is a longstanding tradition in anime of giving giant robots divine names, designating them kami of sorts.’\n\n‘While the language of synchronization in The Big O sounds biblical, the relationship between pilot and robot is certainly not. Because the show is not set in a dualistic Abrahamic paradigm, there is nothing inherently good or evil about these Megadeuses; they are simply supernatural forces in robot form.’\n\n‘Like most giant robots in anime, the spiritual nature of a Megadeus is closer to the concept of “noble kami” than to the completely benevolent and omnipotent Abrahamic God.’\n\n‘From a Buddhist perspective, a giant robot can also be interpreted as a vehicle to enlightenment’\n\n‘Because the robot is also a manifestation of divine energy, the pilot who learns how to control his robot is not only striving toward a sense of enlightenment, he is also putting himself at one with the forces of the cosmos. This unity with the robot is not only an alignment with divine elemental forces, it is also an alignment with the pilot’s own ancestral kami. The kami in question is usually the pilot’s father.’ — This can definitely be seen in Gundam. And also of course Evangelion. In RahXephon, it’s the mother connection.\n\n‘Aligning with a robot’s elemental power, while at the same time coming to terms with the legacy of the father who built it, is a twofold ritual essential to the mythology of giant robots. It seems to be a prerequisite for most stories in the genre ... The rules of the giant robot genre were so well established by the time Evangelion was produced in the mid-1990’s that Eva not only follows these rules but is able to use the conventions of giant robot storytelling to subvert its audience’s expectations!’"}]}

In myths or fairy tales, on the other hand, any single act can be unmotivated and unreasonable in itself, provided it is effective in setting up the explanation of the ensuing acts. The characters accomplish (or undergo) without any surprise the most improbable and strange things, which are impossible to predict or justify. But there is a coherent line that runs throughout the narrative and culminates at its conclusion.5 The explanation of behaviour is therefore to be understood after the fact: the behaviour that leads to the desired conclusion is coherent. ... to ask whether Ea ‘tricks’ Adapa or is tricked by Anu, whether he foresees the outcome or is surprised by it, why Tammuz and Gizzida stand at Anu’s gate, or why Anu waits ‘seven’ days before asking about the south wind, is devoid of meaning in the framework of the narrative logic of myth and fairy tale. Such problems should trouble us only – to use V. Šklovsky’s words (1976: 58) – *‘as much as a chess-player is troubled by the question why the knight cannot move in a straight line’*.\n\n“The second element in the narrative logic of myths and fairy tales to be considered here is that it proceeds through oppositions and reduplications of a somewhat algebraic character”"}]}

Doblhoff's \"cold-cycle\" tip-jet rotors used high-pressure air from a compressor that was ducted through the rotor blades to their tips to power the blades around at a sufficient rpm to generate lift. Hiller's experimentation initially revealed that a \"hot-cycle\" system, which used exhaust gases and an afterburner type arrangement at the exhaust ducts, created greater efficiency and thrust. However, it did not take Hiller long to recognize that the greatest weight savings, and propulsive efficiency could be gained, by mounting the engines directly onto the tips of the rotor blades"},{"date":"2013-02-25T03:04:52.574Z","quote":"True","selection":"A year later, Hiller perfected a ramjet engine that weighed only 5 kg (11 lb.) and put out 14 kg (31 lb.) of thrust when the rotor tip was moving at a maximum operational speed 207 m/sec (680 ft/sec) at 550 rpm. Since the two bladed rotor of the Hornet had one ramjet mounted on each tip a total of approximately 27 kg (60 lb.) of thrust was produced. This does not seem like much, but the only mass that the engines had to move was their own weight in addition to the small, lightweight rotor blades, for which this thrust was more than adequate. Since the rotor was freewheeling, there wasn't any torque that required a tail rotor. The high speed airflow required to start the ramjets was achieved through the use of a small 50 horsepower motor that spun the rotor up to 150 rpm at which point the airflow was sufficient to sustain the operation of the ramjets. Ignition of the fuel, which could be gasoline, kerosene, or fuel oil, was accomplished through the use of a device, similar to a glow plug, referred to as a \"flame-holder,\" which insured re-ignition if the ramjet flamed out."},{"date":"2013-02-25T03:07:53.772Z","quote":"True","selection":"The HOE-1 proved to have a number of operational problems that precluded its deployment in the field. The small helicopter could not be safely approached while the rotors were turning since they hung close to the ground. The lightweight construction of the helicopter meant that it could easily be blown off balance in moderate wind conditions. The flames coming out of the ramjets produced an incredibly bright white halo when the HOE-1 was flown at night. This was a considerable disadvantage in the military environment, and the effect prompted a number of UFO sightings when operated in the vicinity of populated areas. The noise generated by the ramjets was also quite considerable, and did not endear the United Helicopter's Palo Alto, California facility to its neighbors. The most serious limitation was the enormous fuel burn of the ramjets, which consumed fuel at approximately ten times the rate of a piston engine providing the same power output. The fuel capacity of the HOE-1/YH-32 was only 136 kg (300 lb.) This had to supply a full power fuel burn of nearly 272 (600 lb.) per hour, which led to a maximum endurance of just over thirty minutes including start-up and shut down.

Ironically, by this time, Hiller had finally succeeded in overcoming the engineering difficulties in designing reliable tip-jet turbine engines, which would have made such projects feasible. He would not get another chance to develop the technology, before he left his company during the controversial loss of the Army's Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) contract to Hughes aircraft.

And what Abelian (Per Bak-ian) sandpile fans.\n\n‘Creeping determinism, however, is subtly different from hindsight bias and even more deceptive. Hindsight bias, it turns out, can be counteracted by reminding people of what they said before they knew the answer or by forcing them to keep records of their predictions. But even when we recall perfectly accurately how uncertain we were about the way events would transpire—even when we concede to have been caught completely by surprise—we still have a tendency to treat the realized outcome as inevitable. ... But once we know..., it doesn’t matter whether or not we knew all along that it was going to happen (hindsight bias). We still believe that it was going to happen, because it did.’\n\n‘Creeping determinism means that we pay less attention than we should to the things that don’t happen. But we also pay too little attention to most of what does happen.’\n\n‘Just as with our tendency to emphasize the things that happened over those that didn’t, our bias toward “interesting” things is completely understandable. Why would we be interested in uninteresting things?’\n\nOur modern sensibility: ‘If we want to know why some people are rich, for example, or why some companies are successful, it may seem sensible to look for rich people or successful companies and identify which attributes they share.’ We make decisions about our behavior based on how we hope they turn out, rather than what we believe the right thing to do is with no expectation of recompense.\n\nFor a potential catastrophic event, there are necessary but insufficient conditions (for planes: broken radios, fatigue, fog, tower error, stress,...), and we may have some probabilistic model for how often all the conditions lead to catastrophic breakdown. After the catastrophe, though, the conditions become in our heads necessary and sufficient: all we have to do to avoid these is target these conditions and prevent them from happening. \n\nThis reminds me of the “xly” post clipped herein: necessary but insufficient relationships are labeled with “xly” to indicate that they are meaningful but don’t correlate all the time (or in this context, very rarely). \n\n‘creeping determinism and sampling bias lead commonsense explanations to suffer from what is called the post-hoc fallacy’ — in other words, post hoc ergo procter hoc. \n\n‘If you hear a bird sing or see a cat walk along a wall, and then see the branches start to wave, you probably don’t conclude that either the bird or the cat is causing the branches to move. It’s an obvious point, and in the physical world we have good enough theories about how things work that we can usually sort plausible from implausible. But when it comes to social phenomena, common sense is extremely good at making all sorts of potential causes seem plausible.’ —  we have a model for this kind of problem: sympathetic magic and prescientific ways of thinking are “primordial versions of” science (cf., Stephen Asma on Buddhism). \n\nIt’s not possible to ‘attribute the success of the Mona Lisa to its particular features’ — this actually paraphrases the Wikipedia article on Abelian sandpile models! Recall: “Once the sandpile model reaches its critical state there is no correlation between the system's response to a perturbation and the details of a perturbation.” In other words, because there’s no correlation between the event and the system’s response to it in a tuned system, when you’re talking about a major response (like a big sandpile landslide or Mona Lisa), the kickoff event’s specifics is uncorrelated with it.\n\n‘Commonsense explanations therefore seem to tell us why something happened when in fact all they’re doing is describing what happened.’ — This is the book’s theme, if I recall. (I read this first time around May 2011.)\n\nThis section is what I’ve been after since I started thinking about novels and Crusader Kings II: ‘HISTORY CANNOT BE TOLD WHILE IT’S HAPPENING ... surely we can at least be confident that we know what happened, even if we can’t be sure why’.\n\nHe contrasts Tolstoy’s Bezukhov, stumbling around on the battlefield of Borodino, with Danto’s Ideal Chronicler entity, a ‘panoptical being, able to observe in real time every single person, object, action, thought, and intention in Tolstoy’s battle, or any other event’: *‘the Ideal Chronicler would still have essentially the same problem as Bezukhov; it could not give the kind of descriptions of /what was happening/ that historians provide.’*\n\nWhat does this mean? I think this is a really important and interesting point Watts is trying to make here but he fumbled the handoff immediately after this by incoherent references to Danto’s jargon and toy examples. What this means is that the kinds of things we wish to write and read about history can’t be written by just the Ideal Chronicler and its recordings: these have to relevant to some preconceived notion of what’s “interesting” or “important” (cf., Gooseberry in Pratchett’s “Thud!”: ‘what is interesting?’). Watts: historians’ works require ‘foreknowledge of a very specific event that will only color the events of the present after it has actually happened’. To be more concrete: the Ideal Chronicler would have to be told, at the end of the Battle of Borodino, “Napoleon will be considered to have won the battle but will lose the war, and his achievements will be rolled back, and all that will remain are major French institutions...” and the evolution of public thought on the topic, in order to write something like what a historian would write. \n\nWatts is being incoherent (for me) here again with a very important observation: ‘Danto’s point is precisely that historical descriptions of “what is happening” are /impossible/ without narrative sentences’, i.e., that “what happened” implies some criteria for judging relevance:\n\n‘literal descriptions of what happened are impossible. Perhaps even more important, they would also not serve the purpose of historical explanation, which is not to reproduce the events of the past so much as to explain why they mattered. And the only way to know what mattered, and why, is to have been able to see what happened as a result’, and not just what happened in the area under investigation but also what’s happened in the arena of public opinion and academic analysis since then that can shape the future that you’re interested in.\n\n‘History cannot be told while it is happening, therefore, not only because the people involved are too busy or too confused to puzzle it out, but because what is happening can’t be made sense of until its implications have been resolved.’ Nutshelled, thank you Duncan Watts! This is definitely one of the biggest highlights of this book, packed with important highlights well-synthesized (speaking in Milton). \n\n*‘the characters in a story don’t know when the ending is’ ... ‘the ending of a movie is really an artificial end to what in reality would be an ongoing story [to the characters]’. And to those characters, ‘at no point in time is the story ever really “over.”’*\n\nWatts goes on and develops this idea further: when should the guillotine of relevance fall on the historical narrative? ‘Choices that seem insignificant at the time we make them may one day turn out to be of immense import. And choices that seem incredibly important to us now may later seem to have been of little consequence. We just won’t know until we know. And even then we still may not know, because it may not be entirely up to us to decide.’ I.e., *‘Something always happens afterward, and what happens afterward is liable to change our perception of the current outcome, as well as our perception of the outcomes that we have already explained’*.\n\n‘Historical explanations, in other words, are neither causal explanations nor even really descriptions—at least not in the sense that we imagine them to be. Rather, they are stories. As the historian John Lewis Gaddis points out, they are stories that are constrained by certain historical facts and other observable evidence. Nevertheless, like a good story, historical explanations concentrate on what’s interesting, downplaying multiple causes and omitting all the things that might have happened but didn’t. As with a good story, they enhance drama by focusing the action around a few events and actors, thereby imbuing them with special significance or meaning. And like good stories, good historical explanations are also coherent, which means they tend to emphasize simple, linear determinism over complexity, randomness, and ambiguity. Most of all, they have a beginning, a middle, and an end, at which point everything—including the characters identified, the order in which the events are presented, and the manner in which both characters and events are described—all has to make sense.’ — Now this is what interests me, at this time; not how this interferes with our scientific work. \n\n‘For evidence of confidence afforded by stories, see Lombrozo (2006, 2007) and Dawes (2002, p. 114). Dawes (1999), in fact, makes the stronger argument that human “cognitive capacity shuts down in the absence of a story.”’ — Cool footnote!\n\n‘When we investigate the causes of the recent housing bubble or of the terrorist attacks of September 11, we are inevitably also seeking insight that we hope we’ll be able to apply in the future ... whenever we seek to learn /about/ the past, we are invariably seeking to /learn/ from it as well’. Santayana’s famous quote is fool’s gold.\n\nThese are incredibly important topics. Watts has done good by bringing them together in such a synthesis, but I need to do a lot more work in order to make coherent sense of them all."},{"date":"2013-02-24T04:00:24.524Z","quote":"False","selection":"‘people digest new information in ways that tend to reinforce what they already think.

Yet determining which situations are comparable depends on knowing which features are relevant. This inherent circularity poses what philosophers and cognitive scientists call the frame problem, and they have been beating their heads against it for decades ...

This clue has been ignored in the vast amount of literary criticism devoted to Borges’s most celebrated works.’\n\n‘no activity, other than reading, has been more central to his creative process than translation’\n\n‘he at times favored a translation over its original, other times an original over its translation, and he was often interested in weighing their relative merits, aesthetic and otherwise’\n\n‘My method, therefore, differs sharply from Borges’s. For Borges translation was a means to enrich a literary work or a literary idea. For me translation provides a way of understanding his oeuvre.’\n\n‘ The inevitable rewriting of previous works of art in any individual work is also central to Wollheim’s doctrine of criticism as retrieval: “[The artist] will assemble his elements in ways that self-consciously react against, or overtly presuppose, arrangements that have already been tried out within the tradition.”’\n\n‘Gombrich’s suggestion that the study of a work of art should pay as much attention to the repertoire of the artist as to the finished product.’\n\n‘he abandoned two positions he had considered seriously and in some cases defended vehemently. The first is the idea that literature is fundamentally autobiographical and that its ultimate significance is lost on those who ignore the circumstances of individual authors. The second, which he sometimes related to the first, is the view that literature is the expression of a nationality or a national character. Borges was so embarrassed by these and other views he held in the 1920s’\n\n‘Given a choice, he preferred to discuss literary effects rather than the meaning of literary works’\n\n‘since the 1930s the individuality of the writer played an ever-diminishing role in his observations on literature, especially when compared to the impersonal and collective factors of the literary experience. In this context Borges developed a view on translation in which an original work does not harbor an advantage over a translation. The work, for Borges, became a collective enterprise that carries more weight than the input of any individual author, reader, or translator.’\n\n>> can a book about Borges help but be Borgesian? :)\n\n‘His translations transform his originals into drafts that precede them; his own literary works transform his readings into a repertoire of possibilities in which his own translations, and his views about translation, play a decisive role.’\n\n‘In the sections of this book comparing Borges’s translations into Spanish from English, I will offer my own English versions of Borges’s translations in the body of the work and will include Borges’s Spanish versions in the endnotes. In my comparisons of Borges’s translations from foreign languages (German, French, Italian, and Old Norse), I will also include the foreign language originals in the endnotes.’\n\n‘A good translator, according to him, might choose to treat the original as a good writer treats a draft of a work in progress.’\n\n'“It is far easier to forgo someone else’s vanities than one’s own.”3 According to Borges translators should be willing to cut, add, and transform for the sake of the work.' I can see this as being very useful in translating the Norse sagas and songs.\n\n‘the potential to ameliorate a draft should not be taken as an argument against publication, because correcting drafts is a never ending process. Borges was fond of quoting Alfonso Reyes, who would say, “We publish because otherwise we would spend our lives going over our drafts.”5 That being said, Borges would often make changes to existing published works when they were reprinted. Thanks to Jean Pierre Bernès’s remarkable French Pléiade edition of Borges’s Oeuvre—the first extensive account of Borges’s transformations of his own works (offering rich bibliographical information indicating the original publication of many works)—we can begin to appreciate the full extent of his revisions.6 Just as Borges revised his original works, including the contents of his books, from edition to edition, he also revised some of his own translations when published in new contexts.’\n\n‘(“literal translations are not literary”).7 He recognized that in translation some aspects of an original will disappear, but he did not consider those losses necessarily undesirable.’\n\n‘Borges became increasingly interested, especially after 1960 when he lost his sight, in poetic lines that provoked emotional effects in him, even before he understood their meaning, on account of the connotations and even the arbitrary associations of words. In some cases, as in Quevedo’s famous line “Y su epitafio, la sangrienta luna” (literally, “and his epitaph, the bloody moon”), Borges felt that the power of a poetic line can be impoverished by its immediate context or by interpretation.’ Totally true. Taleb copies, 'The exquisite cadavers shall drink the new wine'.\n\nHow is poetry a series of drafts...? The original went down one lane, a translation will go back \"several drafts\" and go forward several drafts more.\n\n‘Petrarch wrote a letter to ask a friend to emend phrases from his “Bucolicum carmen.” He had recently noticed he had unwittingly pilfered them from Virgil and Ovid’\n\n‘Borges would differentiate between what he called “the language of ideas” and “the language of emotions.”’ <-- do not understand this at all... :( Maybe I do now: 'According to Eco, Borges is at his most conservative in his own writing when it comes to the organization of sounds in literature, and at his most experimental when it comes to ideas.' This might be the opposite for Tolkien?\n\n‘In his commentary on Salas Subirat’s translation of Joyce’s Ulysses, a novel he considered failed, tedious, and chaotic, Borges insists on its moments of “verbal perfection.” At times Borges referred to Ulysses as an almost impossible challenge to a translator, by which he meant it would be impossible to render all of Joyce’s verbal experiments into any other language.17 On other occasions he denied that the novel was untranslatable, recommending that it be used as a pretext for the creation of another work.’ /Star Wars/ is something else worth only of being a pretext for another better work (Jackson Crawford's)!\n\n‘As an objectivist Borges was persuaded that the cadences and arbitrary associations of words in certain combinations warrant the claim of “verbal perfection,” and that some literary works are more successful than others in producing literary effects. As a relativist, he endorsed transformations and misprisions, and did not mind if ideas and other aspects of an original were either eliminated or transformed in translation. His objectivistic and relativistic standards converge in his conviction that original works do not have, in principle, any advantage over translations from the perspective of their literary merits.’\n\n‘However, those linguistic aspects that cannot be reproduced in translation do not cause Borges any more anxiety than the fact that a paraphrase is never identical with its original. In general one paraphrases to underscore certain features of a text while ignoring others, and one generally translates to underscore certain aspects of an original while downplaying others.’\n\n‘Where the cadences of the original are lost, the translator may be able to find new cadences that did not exist in the original. In short, for Borges, the poetry of ideas can always be translated in such a way that the original and the translation amount to the “same” text, and the poetry of emotions can be translated also, as a recreation: “[Poetry] can always be translated as long as the translator forgoes either scientific or philological precision.”’\n\n‘\"I believe Benedetto Croce held that a poem is untranslatable, but that it can be recreated in another language.\" Borges agrees with those who claim that “each language has its own possibilities and impossibilities” but does not draw the inference that a translator is doomed to failure.22 On the contrary, he affirms that the differences between languages and modes of expression offer multiple possibilities to a translator whose aim is to recreate the original.’\n\n‘In the case of poetic lines like those of Quevedo and Hopkins quoted above, it makes no sense for Borges to fault a translator for failing to render what cannot be rendered. But such moments of literary concentration are rare in the work of any poet, and they are not the sole province of an original. Indeed, a translation may sparkle in passages where the original falls short. Borges would agree with George Steiner’s conten- tion that a translation can tap into potentialities unrealized in the original, precisely because the linguistic differences or incompatibilities between two modes of expression may bring forth aspects of the work that would be obscured in the language of the original. : In some cases, as in Quevedo’s famous line “Y su epitafio, la sangrienta luna” (literally, “and his epitaph, the bloody moon”), Borges felt that the power of a poetic line can be impoverished by its immediate context or by interpretation.10 One of the compensations for his blindness was his memorized anthology of poetic lines, in several languages, which he considered “unique and eternal,” lines which, in or out of context, gave him a joy that had more to do with associations than with meanings,11 for example Gerard Manley Hopkins’s line “Mastering me God, giver of breath and bread.”’\n\n‘the point worth stressing is that for Borges, as for Steiner, a translation can bring to light aspects of a work that may be lost on a reader of an original.29 But Borges would go further than Steiner. As far as he was con- cerned, a translator can also interpolate his own inventions and excise passages that could have been rendered with ease. A translator can produce an unfaithful work that surpasses the original precisely because it is unfaithful. This is so because a translator can correct mistakes and inconsistencies of a text and edit sections that may obscure an aspect of the work that might be worth foregrounding.’ I shudder to think how much this kind of translation would annoy professional Old Icelandicists or Old Englishicists.\n\n‘A translator, therefore, should not be faithful to an imperfect text, but to a perfectible work. Why should a translator find equivalents for what Borges has called the “idiocies of the text” when these may hamper the very effects the text would otherwise produce? Why should a translator forgo those possibilities and potentialities in a text that the author of the original neglected out of carelessness or lack of vision? Borges’s answer to these questions is so unequivocal that he included it verbatim in several of his essays on translation: “To assume that every recombination of elements is necessarily inferior to its original form is to assume that a draft nine is necessarily inferior to draft H—for there can only be drafts. The concept of the ‘definitive text’ corresponds only to religion or exhaustion.”’\n\n‘In his general views on literature, the work is more important than the writer: “An artist cares about the perfectibility of the work, and not the fact that it may have originated from himself or from others.” “If the work improves, why not? Why not make it a collective project?”’\n\n\n“Our concept of plagiarism is, without a doubt, less literary than commercial.”\n\n‘Borges admired “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” and his views on translation can be read as a compliment to Eliot’s ideas on the depersonalization of literature. Borges’s own skepticism about individuality or personality in literature informs his notion of a perfectible work, his endorsement of the liberties a translator might take, and his suggestion that contradictory versions of the same work can be equally valid.’\n\n‘On many occasions Borges affirmed that after three thousand years of literary production it is highly unlikely that contemporary writers can generate new or original ideas. There is a sense, there- fore, in which translation, in one way or another, is an element of any literary work of the recent past.’ Correct: all works are in large part retranslations, readaptations.  We're just too polite to ask writers too many questions. Untraditional bards!\n\n‘Borges preferred Dante in the original but Cervantes in an English translation. He remembers, perhaps in jest, that Don Quixote seemed to him like a “bad translation” the first time he read it in Spanish.’\n\nCarter Wheelock: “Borges and di Giovanni have created a situation as ambiguous and subtle as one of Borges’s tales.”\n\nEven if something had Borges' approval, haters can still hate on general terms.\n\n‘Borges also regrets that “no one likes to celebrate those pages whose paternity is uncertain.”’ This is because people want to be sure they won't be laughed at for celebrating something others think is unworthy of celebration. (Duncan Watts. MusicLab. Cumulative advantage. Winner takes all Extremistan.) This situation is unfortunate and is only recently being perversely subverted by the arrival of internet memes (O-zone, Justin Bieber?, and others).\n\n‘Wheelock, Bensoussan, and others have a valid point to make when they express serious reservations in their assessments of translations that transform or mollify the uniqueness or idiosyncrasies of Borges’s literary genius, even when the gestures appear to be in the spirit of views that Borges himself held or in terms of the very conceits Borges was fond of practicing. ... it is important to recognize that the reception of his work, for decades, has faced a dilemma: one can accept Borges’s views about the impersonality of literature and thus downplay the significance of his personal genius, or downplay the significance of his literary views in order to appreciate his genius.’\n\n>>> They author is the demiurge of the universe subtended by the original work and its descendants, a universe that is open and universal because it also contains this original work's antecedents.\n\n‘Molloy seems to suggest that once Borges’s readers recognize the Borgesian conflation of fiction and fact they can enjoy it, but she also suggests that there is something misleading about the Borgesian game when it is not clear that it is being played.’ Haters gonna hate.\n\n‘di Giovanni once reported that a university professor complained that a translation of a Borges short story had corrected an inconsistency. The professor would have preferred that the translation conserve the inconsistency, as he con- sidered it a charming Borgesian touch. As di Giovanni recalled the matter: “Borges was mildly angered; first of all, he found nothing charming in the slip, and, secondly, he feels that he has the right to shape and alter his work as he sees fit. One of the great luxuries of working with Borges is that he’s interested only in making things better and not in defending a text.”’\n\n‘An original text offers a translator opportunities precisely because an equivalent word may have different connotations and arbitrary associations in the language or in the linguistic modalities of the translator. Borges also conjectured that one of the possible advantages of a translation over an original is its likelihood to eschew aspects of a work involving historical or linguistic idiosyncrasies that have little to do with why the work is worth reading in the first place. That is why Borges would at times recommend to young writers that they read great works of literature in translation rather than in the original: “It is better to study the classics in translation to appreciate the substantive and to avoid the accidental.” !!!!!!!!!! I didn't know Borges' mind ran down these paths too! Arbitrary and unfortunate connotations and associations will be in all languages and being able to read a work in a couple of different languages can help alleviate them. (This like many things in translation seems to offer local benefits, and global only in a language ensemble.)\n\n*Once* an idea has been expressed in Chinese (or Sanskrit or Icelandic or Nahuatl), it can be translated and thoroughly explained into any other language, and vice versa (from any other language to Chinese). But maybe some languages make it easier to think new thoughts for the first time.\n\n\nLearning other languages is thought to be beneficial because this helps one to create and encounter thoughts that one otherwise would not. *Once* a thought has been expressed in a language, however, it can be translated into any other, and vice versa---with varying levels of fidelity and connotative completeness depending on the target language but I dare say always close enough to enter its speakers.\n\nThe *ideas* of a work can usually be, according to an earlier quote from this book above, be conveyed in a translation. Here's that quote:\n\n‘Borges would differentiate between what he called “the language of ideas” and “the language of emotions.” He maintained that in literary translation ideas raise no significant difficulties, while emotions suggested by words raise problems that are almost insurmountable. Certain works, therefore, afford pleasures lost in translation. A writer like Shakespeare cannot be successfully translated into a foreign language, even into modern English, because “in an English that is not Shakespeare’s many things would be lost.” But with regard to the translation of ideas, he could feel deeply affected by a production of Macbeth in a horrible translation, with bad actors, and misguided scenery.’\n\nI.e., the emotions, the language-dependent features, are very hard to translate to full completeness (impossible usually given the lack of connotative completeness correspondence), but certainly the ideas can be translated and developed and improved. (Remember also that Borges believed correctly that one could be greatly moved by a context-free line or passage, even in a language one didn't understand. The sounds can cause emotion: ‘“A cadence is akin to the cipher of an emotion. Two lines may be conceptually identical but not emotionally; intellectually they may be the same, but not emotively.”’)\n\n‘A translator—like a writer correcting a draft—often cuts, adds, and reorganizes a text to produce a work that improves on rougher sketches. For Borges, therefore, translation from one language to another is a special case of rewriting a draft that does not differ, in principle, from the transformation of a text in the same language, from one dialect or one modality to another. It may be easier, for example, to translate a journalistic article from French into English than to modernize Chaucer or Shakespeare into any modern lan- guage, including English.’ << certainly this is true: McKinney and Minford predispose me to believing that it's much easier translating in space alone rather than in time or space & time.\n\n‘Borges cites a fragment in which the German Romantic poet [Novalis] affirms that words have singular meanings (eingentümliche Bedeutungen), connotations (Nebenbedeutungen), and arbitrary associations (will-kürlichen Bedeutungen).’\n\n \n‘From the 1930s onward Borges continued to think of language in terms of meanings, connotations, and arbitrary associations. This view determined how he examined the vicissitudes of a text over the course of time: the meanings of words survive while connota- tions and associations change, even across languages and modes of expressions, because the same words may have different connota- tions for different language communities separated by space or time. ... He also believed that the transformations of a language, its accidental developments over time, could either improve or impoverish a work [*alpha*] as the connotations and arbitrary associations of words evolve, even as general meanings are maintained. Borges would often indicate that meanings, concepts, and ideas are easier to transfer from one mode of expression to another than are connotations and associa- tions, where emotions play a greater role.’\n\nThere is a LOT to say about this, some of it already noted here and in InstAldebrn.\n\n[*alpha*] especially a short work like a poem or a two-paragraph fable.\n\n‘Borges likens Madrus’s role as translator to the graphic artist charged with illustrating a novel or short story: the artist includes details not necessarily mentioned in the work. Borges does not object, in principle, to the practice of adding details to a work of literature, but it disturbs him when the claim of “complete veracity” is made of any translation that expands the original to produce effects of strangeness or local color: “The announced purpose of veracity turns the translator into an impostor, since in order to maintain the strangeness of what he is translating, he is obliged to express local color, to make the raw rawer, to turn sweetness into syrup, and to emphasize the lot until it becomes a lie.”’ <<< It seems to me that Madrus was having a mighty joke with his ‘traduction littérale et complète du texte arabe’!\n\nBorges' ‘definition of translation he would continue to restate for decades to come: translation is a long experimental game of chance played with omissions and emphasis.’*\n\n‘the incommensurability of any two languages, or even two modes of expression within the same language’\n\n‘Borges, however, does not assume that the effects of a literal translation are necessarily objectionable, because they can enrich and even revitalize a language: “The para- dox is—and of course, ‘paradox’ means something true that at first appearance is false—that if you are out for strangeness, if you want, let’s say to astonish the reader, you can do that by being literal. [Literal translations can create] something that is not in the origi- nal.”’ So Borgesian yet true: the original might have nothing of the astonishing about it but a literal translation can astound its reader.\n\n“If Matthew Arnold had looked closely into his Bible [and Arnold had rec- ommended to Newman that one might want to approach the trans- lation of Homer with the model of a biblical translation] he might have seen that the English Bible is full of literal translations and that . . . the great beauty of the English Bible lies in those literal translations.”68 Had the powerful biblical phrase “Tower of Strength” been translated according to Arnold’s approach it should have pro- duced something akin to the drab “a firm stronghold,” and the “Song of songs” would lose its poetry had it been translated more faithfully as “the highest song” or “the best song.” << My goodness, this is true. The really famous Biblical phrases (a few cited in \"How to read literature like a professor\" and in my Bible illustrated by the great masterworks) overflow with that deep-time resonance (well, not deep-time as much as deep-impact). Brother's keeper. Cup of trembling. Song of songs. NIV and even the Action Bible can't hold a candle to KJV (I believe that efforts to make a modern readable Bible should seriously look at sociolects).\n\n“Newman favored the literal mode that retains all verbal singularities. Arnold, on the other hand, favored the severe elimination of distracting de- tails. The latter produces sound uniformities, and the former produces unexpected surprises.”\n\nIn his famous essay “The Homeric Versions” Borges compares six versions of a passage from the Odyssey in his own Spanish “cop- ies.” Eliot Weinberger restores the original English texts in his su- perb English translation of Borges’s essay. Borges’s procedure and Weinberger’s restoration are both justified. The aspects Borges un- derscores in his comparisons do not involve linguistic differences between English and Spanish but other considerations, such as the reverential manner of one version, the luxuriant language of another, the lyric tone of one versus the oratorical tone of another, the vi- sual emphasis of one versus the more factual emphasis of another, the spectacular versus the sedate features of another. A translation, as opposed to a copy, suggests a transformation that may surpass the original. << a copy seems to be a translation. But it isn't.\n\n“If we did not know which was the original and which the translation, we could judge them fairly”\n\nTruly a magnificently entertaining book on a magnificent bastard."},{"date":"2013-02-03T03:57:28.399Z","quote":"False","selection":"‘One can translate within the same language, and one can copy from one language to another. Borges would call a text a “copy” if the most pertinent observations to be made about it could also be made of the original.

For Borges, a literal translation attempts to main-tain all the details of the original, but changes the emphasis (un-derstood as meanings, connotations, associations, and effects of the work). A “recreation,” on the other hand, omits many details to conserve the emphasis of the work, and it may add interpolations. Since a “copy” maintains both the details and the emphasis that matter in a discussion of a work, most translations, especially prose translations, include some measure of “copying.” A faithful translation, for Borges, retains the meanings and effects of the work, whereas an unfaithful translation changes them.

To anyone independent-minded, these are grounds to question, rather than to conform.’ — much of funding-driven science is so: it builds and then adheres to a common creed.\n\n‘It was probably only in the last century, as a result of promotion of the delights of certain rustic “regional cuisines” by Parisian restaurateurs of provincial provenance, that snails began to be rehabilitated as a delicacy after centuries of marginalisation and contempt. Until the era of short rations in the Second World War, it was said that no top chef would have served them.’ — What can I say, I enjoy collecting these Wattsian tidbits.\n\n‘Compared with the large and intractable quadrupeds who are usually claimed as the first domesticated animal food sources, snails are readily managed. Marine varieties can be gathered in a natural rock pool. Land varieties can be isolated in a designated breeding ground by enclosing a snail-rich spot with a ditch. By culling small or unfavored types by hand the primitive snail farmer would soon enjoy the benefits of selective breeding. Snails are grazers and do not need to be fed with foods which would otherwise be wanted for human consumption. They can be raised in abundance and herded without the use of fire, without any special equipment, without personal danger and without the need to select and train lead animals or dogs to help. They are close to being a complete food, useful as rations for traders’journeys, pilgrimages and campaigns. Some varieties, such as eremina, contain water for several days’ travel as well as plenty of meat.’ — I want some now!\n\n‘In the history of the exploitation of marine creatures for food, it is obviously reasonable to propose that herding may have preceded hunting, for fishing is a kind of hunting which demands highly inventive technology, adjusted to an unfamiliar medium. Mollusk farming, by contrast, seems a natural extension of gathering and can be done by hand.’\n\n‘Off the coast of Senegal, at Lake Diana in Corsica and at Saint-Michel-en-l’Herme in the Vendée, there are islands formed entirely of discarded oyster shells, which are still growing in a sea rich in natural oyster beds.’\n\n‘The assumption usually made by historians is that an increase in the consumption of mollusks can only be explained by a shortage of bigger game. But small, easily managed creatures had considerable advantages over big game, provided they could be supplied in large quantities. Archaeologists label mollusks as a “gathered” food, but where they were eaten in huge quantities it will make better sense, in some cases, to think of them as being systematically farmed.’ — Stupid historians! Go Felipe!\n\n‘two strands, both characterized by a progressive model: agriculture and the scientific improvement of plant food species are conventionally classed as growths from gathering; while herding and stock breeding are treated as developments from hunting. These are marginally misleading traditions: some kinds of farming and stock breeding are probably older than some kinds of hunting; mollusk farming is a kind of herding which is closer to gathering practices than anything which can fairly be called hunting. And sedentary farming communities can acquire domestic animals by means unconnected with the hunt: by weaning strays or by attracting scavengers to their settlements.’ — Thank you Felipe!!!\n\n‘Herding has been classified as an extraordinary development in historical ecology, which could not have happened independently in more than a very few places. If it is now found almost everywhere in the world, that must—according to traditional reasoning—be a result of diffusion: a practice initiated in one place, or a very limited number of places, by a stroke of accident or genius, then radiated across the world, transmitted by migration or war or trade. This kind of reasoning is still popular in scholarship but it really belongs to the mental tool kit of a bygone age. Diffusionism as a philosophy arose among intellectual elites committed to hierarchical models of the world. Only people peculiarly favored by God or nature could initiate great ideas. Other people—less intelligent or less evolved—could only progress by learning from their betters. The idea appealed in a world dominated, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, by white men’s empires, whose justification was that they were spreading the benefits of their own innovations to lesser breeds. It seemed convincing in a world of scholarship dominated by traditions of classical humanism and schooled in the tracing of the transmission of texts. Since cultural developments really do spread by diffusion from a single original source and the same models, the same techniques of research got transferred to other disciplines.’ — Brutal! Thank you!\n\n‘Many hunting cultures do not just accept the bounty of nature. They drive herds where they want them, sometimes constructing drive lanes for the purpose and penning or corraling the catch: this is already a form of herding. Or they produce food by wielding fire to manage the environment. ... Although some hunting communities prefer not to pursue such techniques to the point where they become the permanent custodians of the herds, these hunting methods clearly belong to a continuum which includes pastoralism. Whether to take the process further and become full-time managers of flocks is a decision which depends on a balance of considerations: if the supply of animals for the hunt is plentiful, the extra trouble of undertaking pastoralism may not be worthwhile. The great benefit of undertaking that extra trouble is that it facilitates selective breeding’ — A new twist: hunting versus herding both involve selection, but herding makes it much more natural.\n\n‘Indeed, in many parts of the world, the disappearance of numerous species which were the prey of man in the “great Pleistocene extinction” probably owed something, at least, to hunters’ prodigality: most of the large fauna of the Western Hemisphere and Australia disappeared completely, while the Old World lost its biggest elephants—partly, perhaps, to hunters hungry for fat.’ — Interesting hypothesis. \n\n‘Bushmen who persist with this taxing way of life to this day are obviously pursuing a commitment which has grown out of generations of invested emotion. Cultural capital is tied down in practices that would be heart-wrenching to change for the mere sake of material gain.’ — Never think in terms of few-dimensional subspaces when it comes to humans. It’s not just subsistence, then entertainment. It’s subsistence, entertainment as telling stories, entertainment as making beautiful things, entertainment as making tech advances.\n\n‘It is not always easy to draw the line between a herding culture and a culture which hunts herds.’"},{"date":"2013-02-18T03:04:12.418Z","quote":"False","selection":"‘To give up hunting in favor of herding is always a mixed blessing.'—ain’t it always.\n\n‘Because there is no firewood over much of the steppeland, the Mongols traditionally cooked on fires of dung or fell back on the use of meats which could be processed without fire, by wind drying or by the characteristic method which has impressed and repelled European observers since the Middle Ages: a cut of meat is pressed under the horseman’s saddle to be tenderized in the beast’s sweat by the pounding of the ride.’ — Yes!!! Thank you for being bald, Felipe, Weatherford was too coy to explain this in detail!\n\n‘It is not true, however, that nomadic herders despise the fruits of agriculture: their historic problem has been getting hold of them. Because grains and cultivated fruits and vegetables are alien in the nomads’ environments, they are highly prized and often brought in at great cost, or—until the last three hundred years or so when sedentary societies have opened up a technology gap which nomad warfare could not close—they were wrested as tribute through war or the threat of war.’ — I love the bit about the last 300 years technology gap. But I’m not too sure yet about this notion that nomads prized agricultural production, it doesn’t jibe with the Mongol slaughters in China.\n\n‘It is never satisfying to historians to be forced back on formulations of what “would” or “might” have happened (though this recourse is inevitable in any meditation on an episode as remote and ill documented as the origins of agriculture). We want to know what really did happen and to base our findings on evidence, not on reasoning alone.’ — Interesting notion, stupid on part of historians and anthropologists. You never “know” something to be “true”, your beliefs just define a probability distribution on their correctness. which you use to guide behavior. The best thing about the Bayesian approach to this is the built-in notion of updating beliefs in light of new evidence (even if this is quantitatively never easy). Why can’t historians live with a little uncertainty, with the hope that future work may find a way out of their current quandaries?\n\n‘The assumption that “savage” attainments must be of a kind which requires “little forethought” makes us uneasy, because it is incompatible with one of our most cherished findings about human nature: as we have not progressed in cleverness, as far as we know, since the emergence of our species, we have to acknowledge that genius occurs, uncumulatively, at every stage of history and in every type of society—as well in the Paleolithic as in postmodernity, “in New Guinea as well as in New York.”’ — If this notion is so cherished by scholars, why isn’t it more practiced.\n\n‘“the ethnographic evidence indicates that people who do not farm do about everything that farmers do, but they do not work as hard.” Gatherers use fire to clear ground, renew fertility and privilege or favor particular species. They often sow seeds and plant tubers. They use enclosures and scarecrows to protect plants. Sometimes they split tracts of land into proprietary plots. They have first-fruit ceremonies, rites of rain making, and prayers for the fertility of the earth. They harvest edible seeds and thresh, winnow and mill them. They are often experts on the toxic and prophylactic properties of the plants they use, processing the poison out of their own food and extracting it to stun fish or kill game. Indeed, some of the most reputedly “primitive” people in the world are expert in the control of this recondite scientific knowledge.’ — That first quote is hardcore (Jack R Harlan). "}]}

Put briefly, the principle of tanistry held that the tribe should be led by the best qualified member of the chiefly house. At the chief's death, in other words, the succession did not pass automatically, in accordance with any principle of seniority such as primogeniture, but rather was supposed to go to the most competent of the eligible heirs. By custom, a father's personal property passed, at his death, by \"ultimo-geniture\" to his youngest son by his principal wife. Chieftaincy did not.’\n\n‘Unless the tribe was very large, most tribal interests were usually best served by a timely resolution of the succession question’ — reverse the clauses for more punch: ‘most tribal interests were usually best served by a timely resolution of the succession question, unless the tribe was very large.’ ... ‘in a large tribe, rival candidates for the chieftaincy, each closely backed by his own retinue of personal supporters (nökör), might occasionally split the tribe, either temporarily or permanently. In a succession struggle, the rival candidates and their nökör competed for the support of the tribe's leading men and formed factions that could either compromise or fight. Nor were the rivals limited to the backing of members of their own tribe. If a tribe were part of a confederation, a given candidate might win the backing of the confederal ruler or other powerful elements within the confederation. Tribes or leading tribal families also commonly had special relationships with tribal (or even non-tribal) elements outside the confederation and sometimes even beyond the edges of the steppe. These too could be called upon for support or for asylum in the event that a given candidate met defeat.’\n\n‘Commoners themselves, however, followed the leaders of one or another of the noble clans and rarely formed secessionist factions on their own initiative.’ — what is the basis of nobility (peerage) in this society?\n\n‘Another important figure in tribal politics was the shaman (böge). The nomads' need to know the unknowable under quickly changing conditions and their need to deal with the whims of fortune and the forces of nature lent power to the shaman's role’\n\n‘The tribe's organizational structure would seem to have been a compromise between, on the one hand, the authority of the chiefly and noble clans, each of which retained control over its own commoners, and, on the other, the requirements of grazing and migration’\n\n‘Given the mobility of nomadic life, the inessential character of supratribal social organization, and the fissiparousness of steppe politics, supratribal polities—being based on segmentary opposition—were unstable and frequently dissolved altogether. So there could be long periods when the largest effective unit was the tribe. But even in such periods of lapse, traditions of supratribal society persisted, and tribesmen thought of themselves as belonging to \"nations\" (ulus) that had existed in the past and might at any time be reconstructed under a new or an old name.’\n\n‘Steppe empires came into existence only through the efforts of individual aspirants for the office of supratribal ruler, who, so to speak, conquered the tribes of the supratribal society and then, to keep them united, had no choice but to keep them busy with lucrative wars.’\n\n‘As our present-day experience recedes from the time when individuals as such played the leading parts in history, historians have increasingly tended to downplay the historical roles of individuals, trying to see them and their actions as merely the products of deeper social and economic forces. It is now sometimes difficult even to imagine a historical setting in which society and politics were so structured as to put immense power to initiate into the hands of individual persons, whose personalities and eccentricities thus played a major part in determining the course of history. But in the twelfth-century Mongolian steppes, the population was small-probably no more than about a million or so people. Political structures were fragile, and rule was highly personal.’ — !!!\n\n‘Being  the  ruler's  creation,  a steppe  empire-as  opposed  to a confederation-depended  for  its  existence  upon  his  person.  When  he died,  it ran a risk of collapse.’\n\n‘The  steppe  khan  was  surrounded  by  no  pomp,  ceremony,  or mystery  to  clothe  his  kingship  in  a nimbus  of the  divine  in the  way that Iranian,  Roman,  or Chinese  emperors  were  revealed.  His  pur- pose  was  down-to-earth:  to obtain  and  distribute  wealth.  Great  em- phasis  was  placed  on  the  quality  of  generosity.  (Ogodei,  for  exam- ple,  as portrayed  in the Persian  sources,  seems  profligate  to modern readers,  but  generosity  was  essential  to popularity-and  thus  to  an empire's  cohesion-in  the  context  of  pastoral  society.)’\n\n‘In a steppe  empire-as  opposed  to a confederation-the  bond  be- tween  the khan  and the tribal  chief was the bond  between  leader  and follower,  between  general  and  regimental  commander-but  be- tween  the  two  men  as  persons  not  as  offices.  So  personal  was  this bond-upon  which  the  integrity  of the  steppe  empire  was  based- that  at the  khan's  death,  unless  his  successor  recreated  the  empire on  a similar  personal  basis,  the  empire  soon  dissolved.’\n\n‘No  single  person  was  ever equal  to  the  task  of being  a thoroughgoing  autocrat.  Delegation  of authority  has  always  been  unavoidable,  and  as autocrats  succeeded one  another  on  the  thrones  of  empires,  the  amount  of  delegated authority  tended  to  increase  so  that  bureaucrats  or  oligarchs gradually  drained  away  the  autocrat's  power.  In  agrarian  empires, dynastic  founders  most  closely  approached  the  autocratic  ideal,  and their  successors  distanced  themselves  from  it  more  and  more, unless,  as  usurpers,  they  refounded  their  dynasty  and  repersonal- ized  the  substance  of their  authority.’ — What’s that mean exactly?\n\n‘If  the  empire  survived  from  generation  to generation  at all,  it was because  each successor  tried not to be a successor  in  the  agrarian  empires'  sense  but  rather  a *refounder*.’\n\nEsen Taishi. Selim  the  Grim.\n\n‘Legitimist  historians,  coming  from sedentary  civilizations  in which the pattern  of succession  followed  a more  automatic  course,  write  of \"usurpations\"  and  tend  to  date  the  reign  of  a given  khan  from  the time  of the khuriltai that  acclaimed  him.  But this fails to take account of the  lapse  in  supratribal  government  that  occurred  while  the  out- come  of the steppe  succession  struggle  was being  decided.  The  over- throw  of  a sitting  ruler  by  an  eligible  member  of the  ruling  lineage was  not  \"usurpation\"  in  the  steppe  nomads'  eyes.  A  reign's  real beginning  dated  from  the  winning  contestant's  definitive  triumph over  the  last  of his  serious  rivals.’\n\n‘to some  degree,  succession  struggles—participation  in  a  common  enterprise—reinforced the continuance  of ecologically  unnecessary  supratribal  polities. ‘\n\n‘During  this process,  the integri- ty of the supratribal  polity  continued  through  the medium  of the suc- cession  struggle  itself.  (The  sources,  it should  be  noted,  do not  pre- sent  such  struggles  in  this  light.  The  majority  of  the  sources-the Persian  histories  and  the  more  voluminous  but  less  exploited material  in  Chinese-are  pro-Toluyid  and  might  therefore  be  ex- pected  to emphasize  tanistry  and the legitimacy  of struggles  for suc- cession,  but  they  were  written  not  by  nomads  but  by  sedentary historians  and therefore  reflect the legitimist  conceptions  with which these  historians  and  agrarian  societies  generally  were  imbued.)’ — The fight for succession was the conduit through which the supertribal polity continued.\n\n‘In fact,  a strong  potential  for succession  war  was  always  present  even in the most  harmonious  confederations  too,  because  every  candidate for supratribal  rule  probably  at least  dreamed  of making  himself  a steppe  autocrat,  breaking  the  autonomy  of the  tribes,  and  leading his  united  nation  in  glorious  and  lucrative  war.’ — I’m clipping so much because it’s all so reminiscent of Gibbon and Asimov.\n\n‘to  rule  an  empire  successfully-rather  than merely  reign  over  a confederation-a  khan had to possess  a keen  eye for war  and  politics,  the  personality  to  command  a following,  and the  ability  to  conquer  his  own  people  and  subjugate  them  to his  ab- solute  rule.  The  best  way  to  find  a  ruler  with  such  qualities  was  to see  who  prevailed  in  a  civil  war  of succession.’ — Unjustified final claim. All would know the winner was lucky—the fight was only populated by capable individuals. \n\n‘A  succession  struggle  was,  by  its  very  nature,  one  of  the  high points  of tribal  autonomy,  but  as a given  candidate  for the khanship began  to  win  out,  the  pendulum  would  start  to  swing  in  the  other direction.  Uncommitted  elements  would  go  over  to him.  The  more he won,  the more  factions  would  rally to his banners.’\n\n‘Not  uncommonly,  when  opportunity  presented  itself,  tribal chiefs  rebelled,  but  it was  customary  for the khan  to take  a more  or less  tolerant  view  of  such  circumstances,  understanding  that  a chief's  popularity  with  his  tribesmen  often  required  him  to  try  to maintain  as much  autonomy  as  possible  for his  tribe.’ — This article is basically politics 101.\n\n‘A leader  who  won  battles  won  followers.

Had  it  done  so,  Chinggis  Khan's name  would  be  known  to  historians  but  not  to  history,  as  may  be seen from the example  of Tamerlane,  who  conquered  more territory than  Chinggis  Khan  but  lost  most  of it,  after his  death,  to tanistry.’\n\n‘At  first  glance,  one  might  have  expected  the  Turks  and  the \nMongols  to  have  followed  a  common  pattern  in  the  Middle  East. Both  peoples  came  from Mongolia.  They  spoke  cognate  languages, shared  common  elements  of folklore,  had  practiced  the same  range of  nomadic  adaptations,  and  had  both  first  viewed  the  sedentary world  from  the  perspective  of the  nomad  face  to  face  with  China. ...\n\n‘In  the  desert  habitat,  nomads  and  settled  peoples  had  frequent and  repeated  contacts.  The  desert  constricted  all  agriculture,  both pastoral  and  agrarian,  so that  wherever  pasture  was  to be  found,  it was  likely  to  be  interspersed  with  towns  and  cultivated  fields.  The nomad,  whose  pastoralism  would,  under  such  conditions,  require him  seasonally  to  return  to the  same  places,  wanted  peace  with  his sedentary  counterpart  so  as  to  be  annually  welcomed  back  and  so that  exchanges,  which  occurred  mainly  in  markets  and  eye-to-eye between  the  individual  nomad  and  the  merchant  or  farmer,  could continue  with  a minimum  of difficulty.  Living  as part of a relatively tight  nomadic-sedentary  continuum,  which,  using  his  military strength,  he of course  tried to control,  the desert  nomad  understood agrarian  cultivation  and  urban  society.  In  response  to  his  habitat, he  developed  a  distinct  pattern  of  interaction  with  his  sedentary neighbors,  one  that  stressed  control. ...\n\nThe Turks ‘had  fallen  heir  to  the  desert pattern  of control  that the Arab  conquests  had  bequeathed  to them. They  had spent  enough  time  in the vicinity  of settled  populations  to understand  sedentary  society,  and  they  regarded  themselves  to some  degree  as  its  protectors.’ In contrast, ‘Nomad  and farmer or townsman  were not usually  acquain- tances. Geography  did  not  force  steppe  pastoralists  and  settled  folk together  in seasonal  reunions.  It separated  them.  At the  eastern  end of  the  steppe  zone,  where  the  lines  between  nomad  and  sedentary were  most  sharply  drawn,  Mongolia  and  China  confronted  one another  through  much  of  history  as  worlds  apart. ... The  steppe pastoralist's  political  ideology  did not  equip  him  to try to govern  the agrarian  world;  so  he  left  the  settled  peoples  to  their  own  political devices. For him,  raiding  was  as important  as trading. Here,  the supratribal  ruler  performed  the  only  function  for which  the  steppe nomad  needed  him  (apart  from  his  role  as  the  organizer  of predatory  campaigns):  to  conclude  agreements  with  settled  governments  on  terms  of  extortion.  The  settled  government  delivered wealth  (commonly  cloaked  as return  gifts  and  concessions  in  return for  the  face-saving  device  of  nomad  tribute),  and  in  return  the nomad  withheld  his  raids.  But  when  the  steppe  pastoralist  did  in- vade  the settled  world,  he looted  and destroyed  as much  as his heart desired  so  as  to  remind  the  agrarians  of  the  wisdom  of  rendering peaceably  the  wealth  that  he  wanted.’\nFletcher continues this fascinating line: ‘Unlike  the  Turks,  they entered  the  desert  habitat  suddenly,  en masse,  in  centrally-planned campaigns,  phases  of  a  concerted  and  temporally  compact  effort. There  was  no  time  for them  to  acculturate  themselves  to the  desert habitat;  so they  carried  with  them,  directly  into  the middle  East,  at- titudes  nurtured  in the East Asian  steppe:  disdain  for peasants,  who like  the  animals  that  the  Mongols  herded,  lived  directly  off  what grew  from  the soil.  (The  Mongols  were  not  the  only  ones  who  have compared  the  agrarian  population  to  ra'dya,  \"herds.\")  With  the steppe  extortion  pattern  in  mind,  the  Mongols  did  violence  with a  will  and  used  terror,  reinforced  by  their  ideology  of  universal dominion,  to  induce  their  victims  to  surrender  peaceably.’ According to Weatherford, they also very much sought to avoid spilling their own blood. \n\n‘The  Mongols  came  into  Central  Asia,  into  Rus',  and  into  the Middle  East  like  a  series  of  avalanches.  Ahead  of  them  lay  the fabulous  wealth  of India,  the  riches  of western  Europe,  and  Egypt rich  in  agricultural  production  and  commerce.  There  is nothing  to suggest  that  the  Mongols,  who  had  defeated  the  armies  of the Jur- chens'  Chin  empire  (probably  the  strongest  military  forces,  apart from  the  Mongols  themselves,  anywhere  in  the  thirteenth-century world),  viewed  the  Delhi  sultanate  or the  European  princes  or the Mamluks  as too strong  to conquer.  Yet  the Mongols  withdrew  from their  raids  into  India  after  destroying  Lahore  in  1241;  they  turned back  from  Europe  a  year  later,  before  reaching  Vienna;  and  they failed  to  punish  the  Mamluks  for  defeating  them  at  'Ayn  Jalut  in 1260. Why?’\n\n‘when  Chinggis  Khan  entered  India again  in  1224  he  withdrew  once  more  because  a  rhinoceros  (or \"unicorn\")35  was  sighted  and  his  Khitan  adviser  Yeh-li  Ch'u-ts'ai persuaded  him  that  this  was  a  bad  omen.  (Given  the  beliefs  of the time  and the important  role of the individual  leader  in the Mongols' political  culture,  the  latter  explanation  is  by  no  means  an  im- possibility.)’\n\nAn /electrifying/ punchline: ‘The  old wisdom  is best.  The  Mongols  stopped  where  they were  in India  and  Europe  in  1242  because  of Ogodei's  death  at the  end  of 1241.  They  stopped  where  they  were  in  the  Middle  East  in  1260 because  of  Mongke's  death  in  August  of  1259.  The  decease  of  a steppe  emperor,  as all the Mongols  knew,  was  no small matter.  The classic  pattern  of the steppe  empire,  as I have  suggested  above,  was one  so closely  tied to the ruler's  person  that when  he died,  it stood in real  danger  of  collapse.  If it were  to  be  preserved,  the  preservation would  have  to be based  on political  maneuvering,  struggle,  and pro- bably  civil  war.  All  of  these  followed  the  deaths  of  Ogodei  and Mongke.  The  Mongols  had  little  choice  but  to  break  off their  cam- paigns.’\n\n‘A  corollary  question,  which  I  shall  not  pursue  here,  is  why  the Mongols,  having  stopped  to  deal  with  the  problems  of  succession, did  not  resume  their  conquests  and  continue  to  expand.  For  this, geopolitical  factors,  the  dynamics  of  steppe  imperial  politics,  the small  size  of  the  \"Mongghol\"  population,  the  heat  of  India  and Southeast  Asia,  and  other  reasons,  including  those  given  by Qureshi,  Ikram,  Sinor,  and  Saunders,  will  help  to  provide  an answer.’ — I asked myself this opening question as soon as I came to the above punchline, and my answer was that by then, the four uluses had de-steppified like Fletcher describes the Turks to have done above. They may therefore no longer have had the same needs for conquests nor the resources to achieve those (mobility, lack of defended territory (though I recall from Weatherford that Chingis always had to worry about enemies attacking the ger)).\n\nFletcher acknowledged this possibility: ‘new  tribes  came  into  being  as constituents  of the  \"nations,\"  each of which  eventually  formed  a supratribal  polity  in  its  own  right.’ I would also say that the new supratribal polities ceased being tribal, but rather Persian (Chagatay), Turkic (Jochi), Chinese (Touli) and Mongolian (Ogedei)? He continues, ‘a  basic  issue  confronted  the  Mongols  of  the Hiilegiiid,  Chaghadayid,  and  Toluyid  \"nations\":  should  they adhere  to  their  nomadic  traditions  and  remain  an  empire-or  at least  a nation-of  the  steppe,  or should  they  create  a mixed  society (fundamentally  the  \"desert  pattern\"  of  exploiting  the  agrarian world)? ... Had  the  khaghan and  the  bulk  of  the  Mongolian  population remained  \"nomadizers\"  in the steppe  and followed  their traditional steppe pattern  to exploit  the agrarian world,  their empire  might  have had  a longer  lease  on  life.  But  the  bulk  of the  Mongols  moved  into the  agrarian  world,  where,  as  \"cohabiters,  \" they  pursued  the \"desert\"  pattern  and were transformed  into several  peoples,  several separate  realms.  Speaking  different  languages,  putting  their trust in different  religions,  and pursuing  different  aims  in different  habitats, they  could  no  longer  form  a  single  polity.  The  steppe,  which  had been  their  center,  became  a  periphery.’\n\nBravo."}]}

The emergence of the Turks from Mongolia is a gradual process. Each successive wave makes its first appearance in history when they acquire power in some new region, whether they be the Khazars, the Seljuks, Ottomans or one of many other such groups. The sudden eruption of the Mongols from their \nhomeland was different.\n\nA better circular explanation of the concept may be found in the following often used form: \nThere can be no state without men \nThere can be no men without money \nThere can be no money without prosperity \nThere can be no prosperity without justice \nThere can be no justice without state. \n\nChang Chun's answer to Chingiz: ‘Before this I have had several invitations from the southern capital and from the Sung, and have not gone. But now, at the first call of the Dragon court (he means the Mongol court), I am ready. Why? I have heard that the emperor has been gifted by Heaven with such valour and wisdom as has never been seen in ancient times or in our own days. Majestic splendour is accompanied by justice.

The method is to place a mirror between the parrot and the trainer. The trainer, hidden by the mirror, utters the words, and the parrot, seeing his own reflection in the mirror, fancies another parrot is speaking, and imitates all that is said by the trainer behind the mirror. So God uses prophets and saints as mirrors whereby to instruct men, viz., the bodies of these saints and prophets; and men, when they hear the words proceeding from these mirrors, are utterly ignorant that they are really being spoken by \"Universal Reason\" or the \"Word of God\" behind the mirror of the saints. Earthly forms are only shadows of the Sun of Truth---a cradle for babes, but too small to hold those who have grown to spiritual manhood.\n\n“Turkish craze finds its way into 'Algiers'” By Richard Nilsen, The Arizona Republic ,Feb. 17, 2006: The West and Islam go way back. \nOn the serious side, there were the Crusades. On the more trivial side, there was the Dutch craze for Asian tulips in the 17th century. And one of the more interesting collisions between the West and Islam occurred in Europe in the 18th century with a craze for all things Turkish. It gave us coffee, croissants, Angora sweaters and Mozart's Rondo alla Turca.  It also finally gave us Rossini's Italian Girl in Algiers (L'Italiana in Algeri), which Arizona Opera brings to Phoenix this week. Europe had been under the gun from the Ottoman Empire for centuries, but when the Treaty of Karlowitz was signed in 1699, it ushered in not only an era of peace but a fad in fashion. For the next century and a half, all things Turkish, Moorish and Islamic became the source of the culturally exotic in European minds.  \nIt's really quite stunning to see it all: Turkish cigarettes, Turkish baths, Turkish carpets, harem  pants, slippers with upturned toes. There were harem girls painted by Ingres and Delacroix. The turkey named for the color of its wattles, which matched a popular fabric dye of the time, called \"Turkey red.\" And one of the most pervasive effects was the popularity of \"Turkish music.\" Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote versions of Turkish music.  \nWhen the Ottoman Turks sent janizary bands - their military bands - to Vienna as a kind of culturalexchange program, the European ears were perked by the exotic sounds of drums, cymbals and chimes.  You hear the European orchestra expanded with new percussion instruments at just this time, when Haydn wrote his Military Symphony and Mozart his Turkish concerto for violin. The characteristic rhythm of Turkish music was the march beat of \"Left . . . left . . . left, right, left,\" and you can hear it in Mozart's Turkish rondo as well as in the concerto. And Beethoven even included a segment of Turkish music in his sublime Ninth Symphony, the \"Ode to Joy,\" when the whole thing comes to a momentary halt, interrupted by the burps of a contrabassoon, followed by the Turkish marching music ...\nIn fact, German military music made such pervasive use of the Turkish rhythm that it soon lost all sense of being exotic and became the drumbeat of Germanic militarism: If you watch the Leni Riefenstahl film, Triumph of the Will, about the Nazi Party rallies in Nuremberg before the war, you are nearly oppressed with that \"boom . . . boom . . . boom-boom-boom\" rhythm. That is a baleful end to what began as pure fluff. Operas about Turkish pashas and European women were a regular occurrence. \nMozart wrote his Abduction From the Serail, filled with Turkish effects, and Rossini, decades later, imitated that sound - and pretty well stole the plot - from the Mozart, for his Italian Girl in Algiers.  In it, a crafty Italian woman outwits a foolish Turkish bey and saves herself and her fiancé from a fate worse than Wagner. It's a wonderful opera, full of Rossini's best tunes and imbroglios. You can't leave the hall without them resounding in your head.  A few years later, Rossini wrote a sequel: The Turk in Italy. He knew a good thing"}]}

It's also slightly easier to call from, and embed in, C, in my experiments.\nBigloo has better potential performance, due to the strict typing abilities.\nGambit has the best performance, this is probably debatable though, at least according to the benchmarks I've seen.\nGambit also has the best portability, bigloo and chicken only 'mostly' work on win32 - bigloo's socket support has some annoying bugs on win32, for example, and I've had problems with chicken even compiling properly on win32, often failing to find compilers, etc.\nWhether Chicken or Bigloo has the best built-in module system is debatable, personally I'd prefer bigloo's over the two. Gambit's lack of a built-in module system is offset by 'black hole' which is progressing nicely, and is possibly better than both bigloo's and chicken's, in the long term.\nLicense wise, Gambit is dual (LGPL and Apache), Chicken is BSD and Bigloo is LGPL. All are pretty much equal, really, from an end-user's point of view and none of them should impart any restrictions on any programs you create with them, as far as I can tell.\nEdit: I knew I forgot something, I didn't mention the '4th' option - JazzScheme. Which is really just a version of Gambit with an integrated IDE, a module system similar to bigloo's, and a bunch of pre-built library mappings (Gtk, OpenGL, and a bunch more, iirc).

Let's look at it from two sides: what evidence can help us learn about the topic? and what might have happened in the absence of all ontemporaneous evidence that has been long lost?\n\n\n1. What evidence is available?\n\nReconstructing the linguistic past of the Indo-European protolanguage can go only so far back, which means the picture dims the farther back we go in time. As for the availability of evidence in the formative stage of the Indo-European protolanguage, you can be assured there is none. We can only infer with evidence from the later stages from when written records survive to the present.\n\n\n2. What might have happened?\n\n(1) Minimal Syntactic Construction Requires Maximal Inflection\n\nSentences were probably very short, consisting of 1, 2, or 3 word strings predominantly. With nouns and adjective conveying at least 3 grammatical meanings (gender, number, and case) and verbs conveying at least 5 grammatical meanings (person, number, time, voice, aspect, mode), most simple sentences requiring S+V could be expressed in 1 word, those requiring S+V+C or S+V+O 2 words, and those requiring S+V+O+O or S+V+O+OC 3 words, not counting the modifiers. When context provided continuing (constant) variables, often times a 1-word sentence would suffice. A heavily inflected language made this possible from our point of view, but the reverse reasoning could also have given rise to the inflectional complexity of the language(s) ancestral to the proto-Indo-European tongues, i.e., short made stout.\n\n\n(2) Vocabulary\n\nMost probably no independent tribe or band of tribes had the full classical vocabulary we have in the classics reference room. Similar to an average modern person having limited vocabulary, small groups had only those that were required in their daily material (hunting, gathering, farming, and herding) and religious culture.\n\n(3) Longer sentences beget simpler inflection\n\nEmergence of chiefdoms gave rise to longer sentences. The longer sentences served two purposes: long winding oral literature to satisfy the needs of education, religious rites, and entertainment and memorising catalogues to keep track of inventories, rolls, laws, and contracts.\n\nAs longer strings of words became more popular, the heavily inflected device that used to play a communcative function in shorter sentences began to lose its import. Thus arose from the formerly synthetic language a less inflected analytic language that relied more on word-order than inflection. This pattern has been observed across the attested languages of the classical period onto later daughter languages, e.g. from Homeric Greek to Classical Greek to Koine to Medieval to Modern.\n\nThis scheme proposes that the classical langauges developed from a highly inflected language with simple syntax evolved into a less inflected language with more complex syntax.

This is helped by paper money, roads, law men. Payment of taxes (aka tribute?) in goods can also be an important role. These are thoughts to look again for in Weatherford.\n\n‘The production was centralized on places where the costs of labour were lowest. This, not primarily low transport-costs, explains [that] ... comparative cost-advantages were pulling Asian and American markets together—no matter what mercantilist restriction. Another case was the substitution of Indian, Arab and Persian products like indigo, silk, sugar, pearls, cotton, later on even coffee—the most profitable commodities traded in the Arabian seas in the late seventeenth century—by goods produced elsewhere; generally the American colonies.... Due to this global process of product-substitution, by 1680 the transit-trade of the Arabian seas with Europe had disappeared or was in decline; this was for a brief period cushioned by the rise of the coffee-trade. But it contributed to a prolonged depression in the commerce between the Gulf, the Red Sea and the Indian west coast. This decline of transit-trade was smoothed by internal trade within the Arabian seas. But the Middle East had to pay for imports from India by selling bulk products in the Mediterranean, like grain or wool. A precarious balance ... spawned an inflationary pull both on the Ottoman and the Safavid currency. (Barendse 1997: chap. 1)’\n\n‘the trade, industry, and wealth of Venice and Genoa were due primarily to their middlemen roles between Europe and the East, some of which the Italian cities had preserved even through the Dark Ages. During the periods of economic revival after A.D. 1000; both tried to reach into the trade and riches of Asia as far as they could. Indeed, Genoa attempted in 1291 to reach Asia by circumnavigating Africa. Failing that, Europe had to make do with the three major routes to Asia that departed from the eastern Mediterranean: the northern one through the Black Sea, dominated by the Genovese; the central one via the Persian Gulf, dominated by Baghdad; and as its replacement, the northern one through the Red Sea, which gave life to Cairo and its economic partner in Venice. The expansion of the Mongols under Genghis Khan and his successors cemented the decline of the middle route after the capture of Baghdad in 1258 and favored the southern one.’\n\n‘The Mongols then controlled the northern route onward from the Black Sea and also promoted the trans-Central Asian routes through such cities as Samarkand, which prospered under Mongol protection. Yet all of these trade routes suffered from the long world economic depression between the mid-thirteenth-century and the end of the fourteenth century, of which the Black Death was more the consequence than the cause (Gills and Frank 1992; also in Frank and Gills 1993). The economic determinants of this growing and ebbing trade, production, and income, however, lay still farther eastward in South, Southeast, and East Asia. As we will observe below, a long cyclical economic revival began there again around 1400.’\n\n‘The problem [of specie shortages], in the long run, engendered its own solution. Rising bullion prices, the corollary of contracting stocks, largely account for the intensified prospecting for precious metal all over Europe, as well as the ultimately successful search for new techniques of extraction and refining. And it was the acute \"gold fever\" of the fifteenth century that was the driving force behind the Great Discoveries which would end by submerging the money-starved European economy with American treasure at the dawn of modern times. (Day 1987: 63)’\n\n‘Some estimates suggest a population decline in the New Word as a whole from some 100 million to about 5 million (Livi-Bacci 1992: 51). Even in nomadic Inner Asia, the Russian advance through Siberia would be spurred on by the germs of the soldiers and settlers as much as by their other arms. As Crosby (1994: II) observes, \"the advantage in bacteriological warfare was (and is) characteristically enjoyed by people from dense areas of settlement moving into sparser areas of settlement.\"’\n\n’the relatively greater impact of the Black Death on Europe had also been a reflection of the isolation and marginality of Europe within Eurasia.’ I don't know how legitimate this claim is since the Black Death caused some enormous disruptions in Asia as well, possibly acting as the trigger for the Yuan collapse and the Ming ascension.\n\n‘The Columbian gene exchange involved not only humans but also animals and vegetables. Old World Europeans introduced not only themselves but also many new animal and vegetable species to the New World. The most important animals, but by no means the only ones, were horses (which had existed there previously but had died out), cattle, sheep, chickens, and bees. Among vegetables, Europeans brought wheat, barley, rice, turnips, cabbage, and lettuce. They also brought the bananas, coffee, and, for practical purposes if not genetically, the sugar that would later dominate so many of their economies.\n\n‘Through the Columbian exchange, the New World in turn also contributed much to the Old World, such as animal species like turkeys as well as many vegetables, several of which would significantly extend cropping and alter consumption and survival in many parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. Sweet potatoes, squash, beans, and especially potatoes and maize vastly increased cropping and survival possibilities in Europe and China, because they could survive harsher climates than other crops. The absolute and probably the relative impact was greatest on new crops in the more populated China where New World crops contributed to doubling agricultural land and tripling population (Shaffer 1989: 13). The growing of sweet potatoes is recorded in the 1560s in China, and maize became a staple food crop in the seventeenth century (Ho Ping-ti 1959: 186 ff.). White potatoes, tobacco, and other New World crops also became important. Indeed as we note below, the resultant population increase was far greater in China and throughout Asia than in Europe. Today 37 percent of the food the Chinese eat is of American origin (Crosby 1996: 5). After the United States, China today is the world's second largest producer of maize, and 94 percent of the root crops grown in the world today are of New World origin (Crosby 1994: 20). In Africa, subsistence was extended especially by cassava and maize, along with sunflowers, several nuts, and the ubiquitous tomato and chili pepper. Later Africa also became a major exporter of cacao, vanilla, peanuts, and pineapple, all of which were of American origin.’\n\n‘expatriate merchant and trade diasporas. They had already played important roles in the facilitation of trade in the Bronze Age and certainly did so in the early modem period. ... In the period under review, Malacca was peopled almost entirely by expatriate merchants, so much so that Pires counted eighty-four different languages spoken among them.’\n\n‘Manila counted up to 30,000 Chinese residents in the seventeenth century to oil the wheels of the transpacific-China silver and porcelain trade. Armenians from a landlocked country in western Central Asia established an also landlocked trade diaspora base in the Safavid Persian city of Isfahan, used it to trade all across Asia, and published an Armenian how-to-do-it handbook in Amsterdam. Arab and Jewish merchants continued to ply their worldwide trade as they had for at least a millennium and continue to do so today. New Englanders not only sought Moby Dick and other whales throughout the world oceans; they also plied the slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean, and they regularly buccaneered off the coast of Madagascar.’ --- Now I fear if ReOrient is like a business-book, ignoring the huge graveyard of the ordinary and focused on the rare (how common were Armenians in Isfahan and Amsterdam? and how much can you exaggerate just to make a point?)\n\n‘New World sugar supplied calories to Europe that it did not have to provide for itself. Later of course, imports of wheat and meat from the New World fed millions of Europeans and permitted them to put their scarce land to other uses, as did the import of cotton, replacing wool from sheep that had grazed enclosed land. We will return to the matter of ecological imperialism in some of the regional reviews below and again in chapter 6.’"}]}

On Valentine’s Day in 1349, the authorities of Strasbourg herded two thousand Jews to the Jewish cemetery outside of the city to begin a mass burning. Some Jews were allowed to save themselves by confessing their crimes and converting to Christianity, and some children were forcefully converted. More than a thousand perished over the six days that it took to burn them all, and the city outlawed the presence of any Jew in the city. City after city picked up the practice of publicly burning Jews to thwart the epidemic. According to the boasts of one chronicler, between November 1348 and September 1349, all the Jews between Cologne and Austria had been burned. In the Christian parts of Spain, the people initiated similar persecutions against the resident Muslim minority, driving many of them to seek refuge in Granada and Morocco’\n\n‘The plague not only isolated Europe, but it also cut off the Mongols in Persia and Russia from China and Mongolia. The Mongol rulers in Persia could no longer procure the goods from the lands and workshops they owned in China. The Golden Family in China could not get its goods from Russia or Persia’\n\n‘As foreign conquerors, the Mongols had been tolerated by their subjects, who often outnumbered the Mongols by as much as a thousand to one, because they continued to produce a tremendous flow of trade goods long after the strength of their army had dissipated. In the plague’s aftermath, with neither trade nor the likelihood of military reinforcement from other Mongols, each branch of the Golden Family of Genghis Khan had to fend for itself in an increasingly volatile environment that might easily turn hostile. Deprived of their two advantages of military strength and commercial lucre, the Mongols in Russia, central Asia, Persia, and the Middle East searched for new modes of power and legitimacy by intermarrying with their subjects and consciously becoming more like them in language, religion, and culture. Mongol authorities purged the remaining elements of shamanism, Buddhism, and Christianity from their families and strengthened their commitment to Islam, which was the primary religion of their subjects, or, in the case of the Golden Horde in Russia, the religion of the Turkic army that helped keep the family in power.’ Viz., Islam?\n\n‘Officials in the court decided that they had allotted the Chinese too much freedom and that the Mongols had allowed themselves to become too acculturated to Chinese life. Rather than further integrating into Chinese culture, they intensified their foreign identity and further separated themselves from Chinese language, religion, culture, and intermarriage. In the mounting paranoia, Mongol authorities ordered the confiscation not only of all weapons from the Chinese people, but their iron agricultural tools as well, and limited the use of knives. They forbade the Chinese to use horses, and in fear of secret messages being passed, they stopped performances of Chinese opera and the traditional storytelling and other public and private gatherings ...

The monks, often armed, acquired a terrible reputation for abusing people who served them’\n\n‘After the overthrow of Mongol rule, the triumphant Ming rulers issued edicts forbidding the Chinese from wearing Mongol dress, giving their children Mongol names, and following other foreign habits’\n\n‘They expelled the Muslim, Christian, and Jewish traders whom the Mongols had encouraged to settle in China, and in a major blow to the commercial system of the Mongols, Ming authorities abolished the failing paper money entirely and returned to metal. ... After an abortive effort to revitalize the Mongol trade system, the new rulers burned their ocean vessels, banned foreign travel for Chinese, and spent a large portion of the gross national product on building massive new walls to lock foreigners out and the Chinese in. In so doing, the new Chinese authorities stranded thousands of their citizens living in the ports of Southeast Asia.’\n\n‘While Korea, Russia, and China returned to the hands of native dynasties, the Muslim territories experienced a more complex transition from Mongol rule. Instead of returning to the control of Arabs who had been the traders, the intermediaries, the bankers, the shippers, and the caravan drivers who connected Asia and Europe, a new cultural hybrid emerged that combined a Turco-Mongol military system with the legal institutions of Islam and the ancient cultural traditions of Persia. The eastern part of the Muslim world had found a new cultural freedom in which they could still be Muslims but without the domination of Arabs, whom they never allowed to regain power. New dynasties, such as the Ottoman of Turkey, the Safavid of Persia, and the Moghul of India, sometimes called Gunpowder Empires, relied primarily on the vast innovations in Mongol weaponry, a military organization based on both a cavalry and an armed infantry, and the use of firearms, to fight foreign enemies and, perhaps more important, to maintain domestic power over their ethnically varied subjects’\n\n‘Following their purge of Mongol influence in public life, the Ming rulers went to great effort searching for the official seal of the Mongols, and they preserved the use of the Mongol language in diplomacy as a way of maintaining continuity with the past. As late as the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Chinese court sent its letters in the Mongol language. In turn, the Manchu, who overthrew the Ming in 1644, strategically intermarried with the descendants of Genghis Khan so that they could claim legitimacy as his heirs in blood as well as in spirit’\n\n‘By the end of the fourteenth century, the Mongol holdings in central Asia had fallen under the control of Timur, also known as Timur the Lame or Tamerlane, a Turkic warrior who claimed, with flimsy evidence, descent from Genghis Khan  ... Despite all that Emir Timur sought to do in restoring the Mongol Empire, he did not follow the ways of Genghis Khan. He slaughtered without reason and seemed to find a perverse but persistent pleasure in torturing and humiliating his prisoners. When he seized the sultan of the Ottoman kingdom of Turkey, he forced him to watch as his wives and daughters served Timur naked at dinner and, in some reports, satisfied his sexual demands’\n\n‘When Timur delighted in public torture or piled up pyramids of heads outside his conquered cities, it was assumed that he was carrying on the traditions of his Mongol people. The practices of Timur were anachronistically assigned back to Genghis Khan’\n\n‘The descendants of Timur became known in history as the Moghuls of India. ... Akbar organized his cavalry along the traditional Mongol units of ten (up to five thousand) and instituted a civil service based on merit. Just as the Mongols made China into the most productive manufacturing and trading center of their era, the Moghuls made India into the world’s greatest manufacturing and trading nation’\n\n‘Whereas the Renaissance writers and explorers treated Genghis Khan and the Mongols with open adulation, the eighteenth-century Enlightenment in Europe produced a growing anti-Asian spirit that often focused on the Mongols, in particular, as the symbol of everything evil or defective in that massive continent.’ Racism?\n\n‘The most pernicious rationale for Asian inferiority did not emerge from the philosophers and artists in Europe, however, as much as from the scientists, the new breed of intellectuals spawned by the Enlightenment. In the mid-eighteenth century, the French naturalist, the Compte de Buffon, compiled the first encyclopedia of natural history in which he offered a scientific description of the main human groups, of which the Mongol ranked as the most important in Asia. His descriptions seemed like a return to the hysterical writings of Matthew Paris and Thomas of Spalato, more than five hundred years earlier’\n\n‘In a popular 1924 book, The Mongol in Our Midst, British physician Francis G. Crookshank easily moved back and forth between Mongoloids as a race and as a mental category in what he delineated as the “Mongolian stigmata,” including small earlobes, protruding anuses, and small genitals among both males and females. The obvious conclusion of this linking of retarded children with another race was that these children do not belong in the communities, or even the families, into which they were born’\n\n‘In evolutionary theories of race and retardation, the scientific community supplied hard and supposedly dispassionate evidence of what political demagogues and newspaper editors of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries called the Yellow Peril’\n\n‘The focus on the Mongols as the source of Asian problems, and therefore the rationale for European conquest of them from Japan to India, developed as an integral theme in the ideology of European conquest and colonization’\n\nNehru: “It would be foolish not to recognize the greatness of Europe.

Politics, especially imperial politics, was impossible without such commodities.’\n\n‘The comitatus was among the Central Asian cultural elements introduced into the Near East from the very beginning of the Arab Empire’s expansion there. ‘Ubayd Allâh ibn Ziyâd, the first Arab to lead a military expe- dition into Central Asia, returned to Basra with a comitatus of two thousand Bukharan archers.97 His second successor, Sa‘îd ibn ‘Uthmân, brought back fifty warriors, nobles' sons, from Samarkand, but when he settled them in Medina, he took away their beautiful clothes and treated them as slaves. They murdered him and then, true to their comitatus oath, committed suicide.98 ’\n\n‘The Islamicized comitatus has been nearly universally misunderstood by Western scholars, who refer to it as a “slave soldier” system and argue that it is an “Arab” institution.

Outside Central Eurasia proper, such burials are found in Shang China and premedieval Japan as well as among the  Anglo- Saxons and other Germanic peoples of northwestern Eu rope. The burials are signs that the Central Eurasian Culture Complex was at one time alive and functioning in these places. ’\n\n‘The rewards paid to a comitatus member  were substantial. They included gold, silver, precious stones, silks, gilded armor and weapons,  horses, and other valuable things, as vividly described in many sources.’\n\n‘Though some of this wealth was obtained by warfare108 or tribute,109 methods used by powerful states throughout Eurasia for the same purpose, the great bulk of it was accumulated by trade, which was the most powerful driving force behind the internal economy of Central Eurasia, as noted by foreign commentators from Antiquity through the Middle Ages. ’\n\n‘When Chinese or Romans demanded payment from other nations it is called “tribute” or “taxation” by most historians, but when Central Eurasians demanded it, it is called “extortion.”’\n\n‘in the  agricultural-urban society of China, in which the  people—both in the cities and their surrounding agricultural areas and in the more distant purely agricultural  areas—were in most cases ethnolinguistically more or less identical. The difference was that in Central Eurasia the distal rural  people—the  nomads—were usually distinct ethno- linguistically from the urban people of the  city- states and their proximal rural people, with both of whom the nomads traded and over whom they usually exercised a loose kind of suzerainty maintained by taxation ’\n\n‘To the nomads, therefore, Chinese cities in or near their territory were—or should have  been—just as open to trade with them as the Central Asian cities  were. Throughout recorded Chinese history, the local Chinese in frontier areas  were more than willing to trade with the nomads, but when the frontiers came under active Chinese central governmental control, restrictions often  were placed on the trade, it was taxed heavily, or it was simply forbidden outright. The predictable result, time and again, was nomadic raids or outright warfare, the primary purpose of which (as repeated over and over in the sources) was to make the frontier trading  cities—which  were built in former pastureland that had been seized from the nomads—once again accessible. ’\n\n‘the Great Wall, which mainly connected earlier walls together and strengthened them.

The purpose of the nomadic raids or warfare against the Chinese was undoubtedly mainly to remove the Chinese from the seized pastureland and restore it to nomadic control, as indicated by the fact that the nomads almost exclusively took animals and people as booty on these raids (cf. Hayashi 1984). The theories ultimately based on the idea of the Chinese as victims of Central Eurasian aggression, and the nomads as  poverty-stricken barbarians greedy for Chinese silks and other products, are not only unsupported by the Chinese historical sources, they are directly contradicted by them, as well as by archaeology. The same applies all along the frontier between Central Eurasia and the periphery of Eurasia, from east to west.’\n\n‘All of it  together—the nomadic pastoral economy, the agricultural “oasis” economy, and the Central Asian urban economy—constituted the Silk Road. ’\n\n‘Based on words referring to flora, fauna, and other things, as well as on archaeology and historical sources, it has been concluded that the Proto-Indo-European homeland was in Central Eurasia, specifically in the mixed  steppe-forest zone between the southern Ural Mountains, the North Caucasus, and the Black Sea. ’\n\n‘The Indo-Europeans spoke more or less the same language, but in settling in their new homes they took local wives who spoke  non-Indo-European languages; within a generation or two the local creoles they developed became new Indo-Europe an daughter languages. ’\n\n‘Proto-Indo-European, when still a unified language, was necessarily spoken in a small region with few or no significant dialect differences. ... On the recently growing failure to understand this necessity, and the implications thereof, see endnote 30.’\n\n‘No one can say that the heroes who accomplished these deeds for their people did not do them. The Chou Dynasty of China, the Roman Empire, the  Wu-sun Kingdom, and the  Hsiung-nu Empire are all historical facts, as are the realms of the Koguryo, the Türk, the Mongols, and others. How these nations really  were founded is obscured by the mists of time, in which the merging of legendary story and history is nearly total. Even the relatively late, more or less historical accounts of the foundation of the Mongol Empire contain legendary or mythical elements that are presented as facts along with purely historical events. Yet that is unimportant. What really mattered was that the unjust overlords who suppressed the righ teous people and stole their wealth  were fi nally overthrown, and the men who did the deed  were national heroes. \n\n‘In each case the subject people lived for a time under the unjust rule of their conquerors, and as their vassals they fought for them. By fi ghting in their conquerors' armies, the subject people acquired the life-style of steppe warriors. They also learned from their rulers the ideal of the hero in the First Story, which was sung in diff erent versions over and over from campfi re to campfi re around the kingdom along with other heroic epics that told stories almost as old, with a similar moral. Aft er the subject people had thoroughly assimilated their overlords' steppe way of life, military techniques, political culture, and mythology, they eventually rebelled. If successful, they followed the ideal pattern told in the stories and became free, replacing their overlords as rulers of the steppe. \n\n‘In their successful campaign to establish their power over the land, the former vassal people, now the rulers of their own kingdom, inevitably sub- jugated other peoples, one of whom would serve them, learn from them, and eventually overthrow them in exactly the same way. This cycle began at least as early as the foundation of the Hittite Empire in the seventeenth century bc and can be traced historically in Central Eurasia itself over a period of some two millennia from the first known large, organized state of the steppe zone, the Scythian Empire, which was established in the seventh century bc, down to the Junghars and Manchus in early modern times.’\n\n\n‘[Caesar's] conquests were unprovoked, purely imperialistic expansion, in which resistance—for example, that of the Veneti in northwestern Gaul—was “crushed ferociously, their leaders executed and the population sold into slavery.”’\n\n‘Virtually every account of successful Chinese campaigns into Central Eurasia includes information on the booty acquired, but it is generally ignored by modern historians, who, regardless of where their sympathies may lie, gener-ally list only the number of “plundering raids” by Central Eurasians against the Chinese’\n\n‘the capture of artisans and of valuable trea sure as booty are good examples of what happened in warfare practically throughout Eurasia in Antiquity and the Middle Ages, not only warfare as practiced by Central Eurasians. While there does not seem to have been any signifi cant coercion applied in the actual trading pro cess at border mar-kets, the obtaining of the right to trade was often a matter of diplomacy and involved the threat of war, just as it does today. Furthermore, all states, whether  nomad- ruled or otherwise, used force or the threat of force or imprisonment to ensure payment of taxes and tribute from their subjects, just as they do today.’\n\n‘It is important to realize that before the advent of telecommunications a unitary language could only be maintained by continuous, direct intercommunication among its speakers’"}]}

Watts, Six degrees: the science of a connected age (2004), excerpt from page 263--267.\n\n\nCoase’s main claim, therefore, was that firms exist in order to sweep away all the costs associated with market transactions, replacing them with a single contract of employment. Inside a firm, in other words, markets cease to operate, and the skills, resources, and time of its employees are coordinated through a strict authority structure. Although Coase himself never specified what this authority structure should look like, the consensus of subsequent economic theory is that it should be a hierarchy. Markets, meanwhile, continue to operate between firms, where the boundary between firm and market is a trade-off between the coordination cost of conducting a particular function within the fin-n and the transaction cost of striking an external contract. If the relationship between two firms ever becomes so specialized that one is effectively in a position to manipulate the other, the problem is assumed to be resolved by a merger or an acquisition. Hence, firms grow by the process of vertical integration: one hierarchy effectively gets absorbed into another, generating a larger, vertically integrated hierarchy. Conversely, when a firm decides that some internal function is too expensive, it either spins off that branch of the hierarchy to form a specialized subsidiary, or eliminates it altogether, outsourcing the function to another firm. Whatever the scenario, firms remain hierarchies (only their size and number change), and markets operate between firms.\n\nIt really is an elegant theory, and has such a ring of plausibility that it has dominated economic thinking on firms for more than half a century. But in 1984, a revolutionary book written by two MIT professors, an economist and a political scientist, tired the First warning shots in what has become an increasingly tangled conflict over the true nature of industrial organization and the future of economic growth. The book was called The Second Industrial Divide, and the political scientist of the pair was Charles F. Sabel—the very same Chuck Sabel who accosted me in Santa Fe fifteen years later.\n\nIndustrial Divides\n\n \nFrom an economist's perspective, perhaps the most polemical (if not the most significant) point that Chuck and his coauthor, Michael Piore, made is that the theory of the firm came about essentially after the fact. Only after large-scale industrialization had effectively settled on the model of vertical integration and its associated economics of scale did economists start to develop a theory of the Firm. And as a consequence, it was only a particular type of firrn—the large, vertically integrated hierarchy—that they tried to explain, as if no other theory of industrial organization could even make sense. But looking back at the late nineteenth century, when the modern image of the industrial firm first emerged, Piore and Sahel showed that the hierarchy was nut the only successful form of industrial organization, nor was its eventual preeminence necessarily based on universal economic principles.\n\nVertical integration, of course, did not become the dominant form of industrial organization by accident—for a variety of reasons, it made perfect sense at the time. What Piore and Sabel claimed, however, was that organizational forms arise as the solution to problems that are partly economic and partly social, political, and historical. The strongest manifestation of the noneconomic dependence of economic decisions is that technological history occasionally encounters branch points, what they called divides, at which a decision is made between competing solutions to a general problem. And once a decision is made, the winning solution gets so locked into contemporary and historical thinking alike that the world forgets it ever had an alternative.\n\nPiore and Sahel argued that the first such industrial divide was the Industrial Revolution itself. During this time, the vertically integrated model of huge factories, highly specialized production lines, and generally unskilled labor outcompeted and nearly eliminated the previously dominant craft system of highly skilled craftsmen operating general purpose tools and machines. For nearly a century thereafter, industrial organization followed the hierarchical model. And like researchers focused on a particular scientific paradigm, economists, business leaders, and policy makers simply assumed that no other form of organization was conceivable. The division of labor, industrial organization, and vertical integration were all thought to be interchangeable concepts.\n\nBy the late 1970s, however, the world had begun to changes. The rapid growth of the world's postwar industrialized economies had begun to reach the limits of what their domestic consumer markets could demand, and further growth required a dramatic globalization of both production and trade. Around the same time, and partly for the same reason, the fixed currency exchange rate system of the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement began to break down, and the first cracks appeared in the walls of trade protection behind which many nations' postwar reconstruction strategies had sheltered, Exacerbating these tectonic changes in the global economy were a series of economic and political shocks—two oil crises in quick succession, the Iranian revolution of 1979, and a combination of growing unemployment and inflation in the United States and Europe—all of which eroded the industrialized world's vision of an endlessly prosperous future. Within the span of a decade, the world had become a murkier, more uncertain place, and business leaders had to start thinking outside the box of conventional economic wisdom in order to survive. Although it was clear to anyone paying attention that the postwar prosperity party was over, no one seemed to recognize that the old economic order itself had been overturned—that the world was, in fact. entering its second industrial divide.\n\nThe Second Industrial Divide was therefore partly an economics version of the emperor's new clothes and partly an attempt to sketch out an alternative, better-clothed point of view. The craft system, Piore and Sabel pointed out, had never entirely gone away, having persisted in the manufacturing regions of northern Italy and even parts of France, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In part, it had survived in those places because of their unique histories, the social networks that existed between traditional family-based production systems, and the geographical concentrations of specialized skills they represented. But craft production had survived also on its merits, outperforming vertically integrated economies of scale in fast-moving and unpredictable industries like fabric production, which depends for its livelihood on the ever transient world of fashion.\n\nFar more important than the persistence of the craft system itself, however, was that its essential feature, what Piore and Sabel dubbed flexible specialization, had slowly been adopted by a multitude of firms, even in the most stalwart economies-of-scale industries. The U.S. steel industry, for example, has spent the past thirty years abandoning its traditional blast-furnace technology in favor of smaller, more flexible mini-mills. Flexible specialization is the antithesis of a vertically integrated hierarchy in that it exploits economies of scope rather than economies of scale. Instead of sinking large amounts of capital into specialized production facilities that subsequently produce a restricted line of products quickly and cheaply, flexible specialization relies on general-purpose machinery and skilled workers to produce a wide range of products in small batches.\n\nReturns to specialization, remember, derive from the frequent repetition of a limited range of tasks. and repetition is only possible if the tasks themselves don’t change. In slowly changing environments, therefore, in which generic products appeal to large numbers of consumers and the range of competing choices is limited, economies of scale are optimal. But in the rapidly globalizing world of the late twentieth century, with firms pinned between uncertain economic and political forecasts on the one hand, and increasingly heterogeneous tastes of consumers on the other, economies of scope gained a critical advantage. Uncertainty, ambiguity, and rapid change, in other words, favor flexibility and adaptability over sheer seals. And in the two decades since Sabel and Piore first pointed this fact our, the world of business has become only more and more ambiguous.\n\nRecently I asked Chuck how he felt the ideas in his book were holding up almost twenty years after he had first espoused them. Had he and Piore been proved right? Well, yes and no.Yes, in the sense that the dominance of so-called new organizational forms over traditional vertically integrated hierarchies was now essentially unquestioned (except perhaps in the more conservative economics journals). And yes, in the sense that the reason for this shift was generally agreed to be the sharp increase in uncertainty and change associated with the global business environment of the past few decades, in old-economy staples like textiles, steel, automobiles, and retail as well as the new-economy industries of biotechnology and computing. But there was a sense in which, over the past ten years in particular, Chuck had come to see their proposed solution of flexible specialization as critically incomplete."}]}

The purpose and objectives of a business\n\nAsked what a business is, the typical businessman is likely to answer, \"An organization to make a profit.\" The typical economist is likely to give the same answer. This answer is not only false, it is irrelevant.\n\nThe prevailing economic theory of the mission of business enterprise and behavior, the maximization of profit---which is simply a complicated way of phrasing the old saw of buying cheap and selling dear---may adequately explain how Richard Sears operated. But it cannot explain how Sears, Roebuck or any other business enterprise operates, or how it should operate. The concept of profit maximization is, in fact, meaningless. The danger in the concept of profit maximization is that it makes profitability appear a myth.\n\nProfit and profitability are, however, crucial---for society even more than for the individual businesses. Yet profitability is not the purpose of, but a limiting factor on business enterprise and business activity. Profit is not the explanation, cause, or rationale of business behavior and business decisions, but rather the test of their validity. If archangels instead of businessmen sat in directors' chairs, they would still have to be concerned with profitability, despite their total lack of personal interest in making profits.\n\nThe root of the confusion is the mistaken belief that the motive of a person---the so-called profit motive of the businessman---is an explanation of his behavior or his guide to right action. Whether there is such a thing as a profit motive at all is highly doubtful. The idea was invented by the classical economists to explain the economic reality that their theory of static equilibrium could not explain. There has never been any evidence for the existence of the profit motive, and we have long since found the true explanation of the phenomena of economic change and growth which the profit motive was first put forth to explain.\n\nIt is irrelevant for an understanding of business behavior, profit, and profitability, whether there is a profit motive or not. That Jim Smith is in business to make a profit concerns only him and the Recording Angel. It does not tell us what Jim Smith does and how he performs. We do not learn anything about the work of a prospector hunting for uranium in the Nevada desert by being told that he is trying to make his fortune. We do not learn anything about the work of a heart specialist by being told that he is trying to make a livelihood, or even that he is trying to benefit humanity. The profit motive and its offspring maximization of profits are just as irrelevant to the function of a business, the purpose of a business, and the job of managing a business.\n\nIn fact, the concept is worse than irrelevant: it does harm. It is a major cause of the misunderstanding of the nature of profit in our society and of the deep-seated hostility to profit, which are among the most dangerous diseases of an industrial society. It is largely responsible for the worst mistakes of public policy---in this country as well as in Western Europe---which are squarely based on the failure to understand the nature, function, and purpose of business enterprise. And it is in large part responsible for the prevailing belief that there is an inherent contradiction between profit and a company's ability to make a social contribution. Actually, a company can make a social contribution only if it is highly profitable.\n\nTo know what a business is, we have to start with its purpose. Its purpose must lie outside of the business itself. In fact, it must lie in society since business enterprise is an organ of society. There is only one valid definition of business purpose: to create a customer."}]}

Another key advantage of Lua is its embedding capabilities: once code has been prototyped, it can be turned into a ﬁnal system/product with very little extra work. Extra performance can be obtained using LuaJIT, yielding C-like performance for most of the pure Lua code.

The result is a binary term-document incidence matrix , as in Figure 1.1 . Terms are the indexed units (further discussed in Section 2.2 ); they are usually words, and for the moment you can think of them as words, but the information retrieval literature normally speaks of terms because some of them, such as perhaps I-9 or Hong Kong are not usually thought of as words.

In other words, you might be struggling now with selecting which stocks to buy—if you follow this book’s advice, you might stop worrying about stocks and start buying land to start up natural farming.\n\n‘In every domain or area of application, we propose rules for moving from the fragile toward the antifragile, through reduction of fragility or harnessing antifragility’ — see above. You move from fragile (predictive) to antifragile (nonpredictive) by reevaluating your life plan (à la Remy in the beginning of /Ratatoullie/).\n\n‘An annoying aspect of the Black Swan problem—in fact the central, and largely missed, point—is that the odds of rare events are simply not computable’ — really, I thought this was the central claim of /The Black Swan/: that fat-tailed random variables have parameters and densities that can’t be empirically well-estimated: there’s /nothing/ you can do about it when the expectation and variance integrals diverge.\n\n‘“robust” is certainly not good enough. In the long run everything with the most minute vulnerability breaks’ — again I am reminded that the actions one takes when trying to robustify life are /very/ different than those taken when trying to /antifragilize/ your life.\n\n‘Engineers and tinkerers develop things while history books are written by academics; we will have to refine historical interpretations of growth, innovation, and many such things’ — the book should be good.\n\n‘You cannot say with any reliability that a certain remote event or shock is more likely than another (unless you enjoy deceiving yourself), but you can state with a lot more confidence that an object or a structure is more fragile than another should a certain event happen’ — Rickards mentioned in his talk at JHUAPL’s seminar that you can’t predict exactly where a car skidding on an icy mountain road will end up but you can predict that the system is unstable.\n\n‘(unscientific) overestimation of the reach of scientific knowledge’\n\nAntifragility ‘likes volatility et al. It also likes time.’ — plants and herds, spaced-repetition system cards.\n\n‘Time is functionally similar to volatility: the more time, the more events, the more disorder. Consider that if you can suffer limited harm and are antifragile to small errors, time brings the kind of errors or reverse errors that end up benefiting you. This is simply what your grandmother calls experience.’ — Experience can come from unhappy events.\n\n‘Commerce, business, Levantine souks (though not large-scale markets and corporations) are activities and places that bring out the best in people, making most of them forgiving, honest, loving, trusting, and open-minded. As a member of the Christian minority in the Near East, I can vouch that commerce, particularly small commerce, is the door to tolerance—the only door, in my opinion, to any form of tolerance. It beats rationalizations and lectures. Like antifragile tinkering, mistakes are small and rapidly forgotten.’\n\n‘Logically, the exact opposite of a “fragile” parcel would be a package on which one has written “please mishandle” or “please handle carelessly.” Its contents would not just be unbreakable, but would benefit from shocks and a wide array of trauma’ — this is overselling it: some of the contents of the antifragile box may, upon mishandling, be broken, but all in all, the trauma would benefit the entire system, and your champagne glasses might become gold coins, or tree seeds.\n\n‘Half of life—the interesting half of life—we don’t have a name for’\n\n‘You want to be Phoenix, or possibly Hydra’\n\n‘We know more than we think we do, a lot more than we can articulate’\n\n‘the apophatic (what cannot be explicitly said, or directly described, in our current vocabulary)’\n\n‘These populations are culturally, though not biologically, color-blind. Just as we are intellectually, not organically, antifragility-blind. To see the difference just consider that you need the name “blue” for the construction of a narrative, but not when you engage in action.’\n\n‘Let us call Mithridatization the result of an exposure to a small dose of a substance that, over time, makes one immune to additional, larger quantities of it. It is the sort of approach used in vaccination and allergy medicine. It is not quite antifragility, still at the more modest level of robustness, but we are on our way. And we already have a hint that perhaps being deprived of poison makes us fragile and that the road to robustification starts with a modicum of harm.’\n\n‘Some researchers hold that the benefits of vegetables may not be so much in what we call the “vitamins” or some other rationalizing theories (that is, ideas that seem to make sense in narrative form but have not been subjected to rigorous empirical testing), but in the following: plants protect themselves from harm and fend off predators with poisonous substances that, ingested by us in the right quantities, may stimulate our organisms—or so goes the story.’\n\n‘The excess energy released from overreaction to setbacks is what innovates’\n\n‘note for now the disproportionate contribution of uneducated technicians and entrepreneurs to various technological leaps, from the Industrial Revolution to the emergence of Silicon Valley’\n\n‘Many, like the great Roman statesman Cato the Censor, looked at comfort, almost any form of comfort, as a road to waste. ... The record shows that, for society, the richer we become, the harder it gets to live within our means. Abundance is harder for us to handle than scarcity.’\n\n‘If tired after an intercontinental flight, go to the gym for some exertion instead of resting. Also, it is a well-known trick that if you need something urgently done, give the task to the busiest (or second busiest) person in the office. Most humans manage to squander their free time, as free time makes them dysfunctional, lazy, and unmotivated—the busier they get, the more active they are at other tasks. Overcompensation, here again’ — the personal productivity people indeed do say this: if you want to get more done, allow yourself less time at work. Instead of 8 hours at 25% productivity, you’ll spend 4 hours at 95% productivity.\n\n‘One should have enough self-control to make the audience work hard to listen, which causes them to switch into intellectual overdrive.’\n\n‘Redundancy is ambiguous because it seems like a waste if nothing unusual happens. Except that something unusual happens—usually.’\n\nMost people, even if they aren’t Soviet-Harvard types, /want/ to live in a world run by Soviet-Harvards, the world promised by Soviet-Harvards. The experts and the planners didn’t become powerful by chance—their popularity is a natural outcome of the Enlightenment ideals. “I’d like to live in a society of comfort, with a side of no-Viking-Greek-Mongol-pillaging-raping-plundering, where every day is mostly like the one before.” Ask and thou might receive. \n\n‘A system that overcompensates is necessarily in overshooting mode, building extra capacity and strength in anticipation of a worse outcome and in response to information about the possibility of a hazard. ... redundancy is not defensive; it is more like investment than insurance’\n\nprepare ‘for what has not happened before, assuming worse harm is possible.’\n\n‘If humans fight the last war, nature fights the next one.’ — Presumably it extrapolates harm by an evolutionarily-derived scaling factor.\n\nmaximum lifts: ‘This method consisted of short episodes in the gym in which one focused solely on improving one’s past maximum in a single lift, the heaviest weight one could haul, sort of the high-water mark. The workout was limited to trying to exceed that mark once or twice, rather than spending time on un-entertaining time-consuming repetitions’\n\n‘What does “fitness” mean? Being exactly tuned to a given past history of a specific environment, or extrapolating to an environment with stressors of higher intensity? Many seem to point to the first kind of adaptation, missing the notion of antifragility. But if one were to write down mathematically a standard model of selection, one would get overcompensation rather than mere “fitness.” ... a stochastic process subjected to an absorbing barrier will have an observed mean higher than the barrier.’\n\n‘If antifragility is what wakes up and overreacts and overcompensates to stressors and damage, then one of the most antifragile things you will find outside economic life is a certain brand of refractory love (or hate), one that seems to overreact and overcompensate for impediments’\n\n‘antifragility is what wakes up and overreacts and overcompensates to stressors and damage’\n\n\"My son, I am very disappointed in you,\" he said. \"I never hear anything wrong said about you. You have proven yourself incapable of generating envy.\"\n\n'With few exceptions, those who dress outrageously are robust or even antifragile in reputation; those clean-shaven types who dress in suits and ties are fragile to information about them.'\n\n'Lions are exterminated by the Canaanites, Phoenicians, Romans, and later inhabitants of Mount Lebanon, leading to the proliferation of goats who crave tree roots, contributing to the deforestation of mountain areas, consequences that were hard to see ahead of time.'\n\n'your bones will get stronger when subjected to gravity, say, after your (short) employment with a piano moving company. They will become weaker after you spend the next Christmas vacation in a space station with zero gravity or (as few people realize) if you spend a lot of time riding a bicycle. The skin on the palms of your hands will get calloused if you spend a summer on a Soviet-style cooperative farm. Your skin lightens in the winter and tans in the summer (especially if you have Mediterranean origins, less so if you are of Irish or African descent or from other places with more uniform weather throughout the year)'\n\n'We just cannot isolate any causal relationship in a complex system.'\n\n'my health, provided of course that I manage to overcome the snake or vampire after an arduous, hopefully heroic fight and have a picture taken next to the dead predator. Such a stressor would be certainly better than the mild but continuous stress of a boss, mortgage, tax problems, guilt over procrastinating with one's tax return, exam pressures, chores, emails to answer, forms to complete, daily commutes-things that make you feel trapped in life. In other words, the pressures brought about by civilization.'\n\n'The fragilista mistakes the economy for a washing machine that needs monthly maintenance, or misconstrues the properties of your body for those of a compact disc player. Adam Smith himself made the analogy of the economy as a watch or a clock that once set in motion continues on its own. But I am certain that he did not quite think of matters in these terms, that he looked at the economy in terms of organisms but lacked a framework to express it.'\n\n'And once in a while one hears shouts of \"who is governing us?\" as if the world needs someone to govern it.'\n\n'for something organic, equilibrium (in that sense) only happens with death.'\n\n'You pick up a language best thanks to situational difficulty, from error to error, when you need to communicate under more or less straining circumstances' --- a myth, according to Antimoon and AJATT, whom I'm inclined to believe.\n\n'What a tourist is in relation to an adventurer, or a flâneur, touristification is to life'\n\n\nOn ‘Ancestral life’ he says: ‘all life was random stimuli and nothing, good or bad, ever felt like work. Dangerous, yes, but boring, never.’\n\n‘Restaurants are fragile; they compete with each other, but the collective of local restaurants is antifragile for that very reason. Had restaurants been individually robust, hence immortal, the overall business would be either stagnant or weak, and would deliver nothing better than cafeteria food—and I mean Soviet-style cafeteria food.’\n\nLet it be known that Khatzumoto has been about some of these antifragility ideas and applying them to Japanese language acquisition for years now: http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/social-resistance\n\n‘a different, stronger variety of antifragility linked to evolution that is beyond hormesis—actually very different from hormesis; it is even its opposite. It can be described as hormesis—getting stronger under harm—if we look from the outside, not from the inside.’\n\n‘By some nasty property, a random event is, well, random. It does not advertise its arrival ahead of time’\n\n‘They can prepare for the next war, but not win it.’\n\n‘Post-event adaptation, no matter how fast, would always be a bit late.’ — Very interesting phrase, ‘post-event adaptation’.\n\n‘fell into the common mental distortion of thinking that the future sends some signal detectable by us. We wish.’\n\n‘nature is antifragile up to a point but such point is quite high—it can take a lot, a lot of shocks.’\n\n‘Organisms Are Populations and Populations Are Organisms’\n\n‘the random element in trial and error is not quite random, if it is carried out rationally, using error as a source of information. If every trial provides you with information about what does not work, you start zooming in on a solution’\n\nIn good systems, ‘mistakes lower the odds of future mistakes’"}]}

Çelebi recalled that no chronicle ever mentioned the tying and untying of soldier's backpacks. As for flea hunting, that was never spoken of either.’\n\n‘\"What about the /akinxhis/? ..

In truth, the vast Empire of which are all so proud was enlarged only by these blistered and torn feet.\" ’\n\n‘\"At the behest of the Padishah, master of the universe, to whom men and genies owe total obedience, a myriad harems were abandoned and the lions set forth for the land of the Shqipetars...\"’\n\n‘Mevla Çelebi was sufficiently astute not to turn his head towards the general in case the latter, once he had regained his poise, might feel annoyed at having been caught in a moment of weakness by a mere chronicler, or, in other words, at having let himself be seen to be astonished, when he was supposed to be far above such emotions.’\n\n‘\"Taxation. ... You don't realize the full meaning of that word, nor how many things, including the siege of this fortress, depend on it.\"’\n\n‘/These hallucinations, no doubt caused by weariness and waiting,, are perhaps distant reminiscences of the time when the Albanians, like all other peoples of the Balkan Peninsula, believed in a multiplicity of gods. Many of us are convinced that these divinities are not only gathering in the heavens above us, but will sway the outcome of battle, as they did in the past. They hope that the heavens which have been less clement to us, for who knows what reason, will look on us more kindly and take our side, as they did long ago. We shall hear the rumblings of the wheels of the celestial chariots and the rustling of their wings, so they say, and we no longer know whether the outcome of the fight and the fate of each of us will be fixed on this blackish earth of up on high, among the clouds./’\n\n‘But the Pasha knew from experience that if they were allowed to pillage before the day of the assault, then the booty they would gather would bring the instinct of preservation to the fore and thus diminish their thirst for battle. He wanted the citadel to be not just a monster to be vanquished  but a prize that all would hanker after.’\n\n‘\"It's going to be quite a night when we take the citadel! A real riot! Just wait to see the orgies we'll have! When the men have taken their pleasure they'll swap their captives. They'll keep them for an hour, then sell them on to buy others. The girls will go from tent to tent. There'll be brawls. Maybe even murders!\"’\n\n‘\"Your name will be remembered.\" \"For good or for bad?\" \"Does it matter? In this world nothing is either good or bad for all men.\"’\n\n‘\"Every people in the world goes on increasing at a greater or lesser rate. The annual increase is usually around twenty or thirty people per thousand.\" It was the first time Çelebi had heard figures of that sort. The books he read didn't generally contain that kind of information.\"’\n\n‘Skanderbeg would speak only Latin, the better to mark his complete break with the Empire. ... \"He broke one of the dreams of our empire. You know which one? The most beautiful dream of all: bringing the Albanian Catholics back into the bosom of Islam.\" Their conversion had been a miracle. To be sure, there hand't been many of them, only a handful really, but you mustn't forget they were ancient Christians, they had adopted the faith thirteen centuries ago and since then had been attached to the Church of Rome and under allegiance to it. So it was a sign that Islam was managing to make a breach in Christianity in one of its staunchest bastions. No better news had ever reached the heart of the Empire. But the dream was soon destroyed by that demon with a double name, George Castrioti-Skanderbeg. ’\n\n‘\"Normal-looking people are those I fear the most\"’\n\n‘\"He's in the process of achieving an uncommon exploit. ... He's trying to create a second Albania, outside of anyone's reach, a kind of immaterial Albania. So that when one day this Albania, the terrestrial one, falls to the Empire, that other, ghostly Albania, its shadow-self will go on wandering among the clouds... He's devoted himself to a task which almost nobody has ever thought of before: how to re-use a defeat... the eternal recycling of defeat in battle. ... He's trying to oblige us to fight his shadow. To vanquish a ghost, so to speak, the image of his own defeat.\"’\n\n‘\"a strange rumour spread among the officers that Skanderbeg didn't exist, and never had existed. At first this truck everyone as good news, but we soon saw that it was the opposite. Why? Because, as I told you before, if there is no Skanderbeg, then we are fighting a ghost. It would be like struggling with one of the departed. What can ou do if you are attacked by the dead.... so if you try to slay a ghost, all you do is bring it back to life.\"’\n\n‘\"We confronted the Balkans sixty years ago, on the plains of Kosovo. My father was there, and he never stopped talking about that battle. That's when we saw them all gathered together---Serbs, Albanians, Bosniaks, Croats and Romanians, all allied against us. The fight lasted ten hours, as you know. For the first time we saw our army based on land and obedience up against an opponent driven by pride and daring. Our soldiers, who had no titles or noms de guerre, some of whom didn't even have a family name, just their first name, overcame those proud counts and barons. Now, Çelebi, think what a marvel it would be to mix the noble earth of Anatolia with those rocks that spark!\"’\n\n‘\"the poison of jealousy\" ’\n\n‘\"A general who destroys your supply train before attacking you is a true soldier.\"’\n\n‘He cited the names of other besieged garrisons and citadels that had been brought low by water, a weapon more fearsome than the sword.’\n\n‘Çelebi felt as if he really had returned from the grave. In it he had buried his only chronicle that was hostile to the State.’\n\n‘\"I remember that at the first siege of Szemendre we spent a week flinging rats, dogs ad even dead donkeys into the fortress. Then they took to catapulting the corpses of prisoners, and the minders of the machine got so carried away that they started hurling vats of waste water, night soil, and god knows what else over the walls. Sure, the defenders caught diseases and finally surrendered, but what was the point? The stink was so sickening that ou soldiers wouldn't go into the place once it was ours.\"’\n\n‘Once again he cantered alongside the wall at whose foot what people call a \"war\" was taking place. On this occasion  it took the form of a human mass rising from below towards another mass of men overhead.’"}]}

The reliability and accuracy of printing allowed people to present their ideas with fewer claims and more logic, with less allegory but tighter reasoning. So I wondered how computers could change the way ideas are presented and tested.'\n\n'Before I got involved with computers I had made a living teaching guitar. I was thinking about the aesthetic relationship people have with their musical instruments and the phrase popped into my mind: \"an instrument whose music is ideas.\"'\n\n'the Dynabook idea. To really use a computer, you've got to be the author as well as the reader. Or in terms of music, a computer is something through which you can compose and play'\n\n'The last 20 years have been basically air guitar. The same thing happened back when television came along. In 1945, people thought that television would bring serious works of theater to the general public.'\n\n'Literature is a conversation in writing about important ideas. ... But somehow we've come to think of science and mathematics as being apart from literature. In spite of the fact that our society is built largely on the technologies that come out of understanding science and math, we've ceased to regard literacy about these things as important. And that's a big mistake. Literacy is not just about being able to read street signs or medicine labels. It means being able to deal in the world of ideas.'\n\n'I think it was Stravinsky who said, \"Talking about music is like dancing about architecture.\" Music is already a means of expression in itself. There's only so much you can say before it's all bullshit, because what is special about music is precisely the stuff that you can't put into words.' --- A similar but less general idea is the Neal Stephenson--Michael Drout divide (writing SF versus writing about written SF).\n\n'people all have got an instrument inside them. If you have a great musician and a bunch of children, you've got music, because that person can teach them how to sing. ... You can look for the music inside the piano, but that's not where it is. Same thing with the Dynabook. You don't need technology to learn science and math.'\n\n'Marshall McLuhan made the point that one of the crucial things about printed books was that you didn't have to read them in a social setting, such as a classroom. People can pursue knowledge independently and from the most unorthodox, subversive, or just plain weird points of view. But that is rarely how things are taught in school. Most educators want kids to learn things in the form of belief rather than being able to construct a kind of skeptical scaffolding, which is what science is all about. The ability to explore and test multiple points of view is one of the great strengths of our culture, but you'd never know it by looking at a classroom.'\n\n'Science today is taught in America as a secular religion. But science is not the same as knowing the things learned by science.' --- Like dancing about architecture or Stephenson on Drout, doing science has nothing to do with reading science. Dawkins writing /The Selfish Gene/---that was biology and brilliance. Your old mum reading Dawkins---that was just entertainment. Your old mum reading Dawkins and then starting experimenting with fermenting and permaculture---that's back to biology.\n\n'One of the problems with the way computers are used in education is that they are most often just an extension of this idea that learning means just learning accepted facts. But what really interests me is using computers to transmit ideas, points of view, ways of thinking. You don't need a computer for this, ... just as [you don't need] a musical instrument [to make music].'\n\n'Seymour Papert used to talk about the kid who has difficulty in mathematics. Typically, the teacher will say, \"Well, this kid is not math-minded. Let's try the kid on something else.\" But if the kid were having difficulty in French, we couldn't say that that kid is not French-minded, because we know that had the kid been born in France he or she would have no trouble learning French. So Papert's idea was that there's something environmentally wrong about the way math is taught to kids.'\n\n'the biggest question about education is, \"What is this kid going to do when teachers and parents are not around?\" If children love the learning process, they want to spend all their time at it. If they don't love it, it doesn't matter much what you do in a classroom.'"}]}

IOW the dominant plant type is a multi-stemmed woody plant less than 5 metres tall. It isn’t accurate to say that heath has plenty of grass. Heathland can include grasses and herbs, but those plant forms don’t dominate. It also isn’t accurate to say that heath is more or less flat. Most of the world’s heathlands occupy skeletal or severely leached soils on moderate to steep slopes. \n\nMoor is essentially synonymous with elevated marsh. A marsh is an essentially treeless system that is poorly drained and at least seasonally waterlogged. A moor is just the same but it exists at elevation WRT to the surrounding landscape, as opposed to ‘standard’ marshlands that exist mostly in riparian locales. Moors can be dominated by grass, but they can also be dominated by forbs, mosses or even heath.\n\n\nSteppe and prairie are essentially synonymous. They are simply temperate open grasslands. Being grasslands they are dominated by grass and of course have few tress. Neither prairie nor step are necessarily flat land, though for various reason they typically are.\n\nSavannah/savanna is the name for a woodland that has a continuous grass layer. Many woodlands and forests have some grass in the ground layer but savanna is distinguished by a complete grass covering that permits regular low intensity fires. It is in no way accurate to say that savannas have few trees. Tree densities in savannas are often higher than in forests. You can see an example of a ‘typical’ savanna here. The difference is that savanna trees tend to be much smaller and thus produce a much more incomplete canopy cover. \n\nVeldt is a generic Southern African word borrowed from the Flemish word for field. These days it refers to grazing land. That means it may apply to savanna, grassland or to cleared forest land. Natural veldt is mostly savanna but there are some significant areas of grassland.\n\nMeadow is a very European word for utilised grassland. Meadow can be natural or it can be created through clearing of forest. The word meadow tends to refer to flat land these days because the remaining ‘meadows’ are often hayfields, which are easier to bale mechanically if they are flat. However traditionally meadows were restricted to land less suitable for cropping, and as a result most meadows were on undulating land or hillsides.\n"}]}

The West Syrian church was Jacobite; East Syrians were Nestorian. Using these sectarian labels is misleading if it paints these churches as anything less than authentically Christian. Not surprisingly, modern adherents resent the names, just as much as a Roman Catholic would hate to be described as a papist or a Romanist.’\n\n‘The Mongol ruler whom I call Hulegu has in various sources been referred to as Hulagu, Holaaku, and Hülâgû, while Genghis Khan is more correctly called Chinggis. Older sources refer to the Uygur people as Uighurs, and to the Ongguds as Onguts.’\n\n‘Christianity appears to have spread freely and inexorably, so that we rarely think of major reverses or setbacks. When we do hear of disasters or persecutions, they are usually mentioned as the pre- lude to still greater advances, an opportunity for heroic resistance to oppression. Protestants know how their faith survived all the perse- cutions and slaughter of the wars of religion; Catholics recall how the worst atrocities inflicted by Protestant and atheist regimes could not silence true belief. Modern observers witness the survival of the churches under Communism, and the ultimate triumph symbolized by Pope John Paul II. ... Anyone familiar with Christian history has read of the planting, rise, and development of churches, but how many know accounts of the decline or extinction of Christian communities or institutions? Most Christians would find the very concept unsettling. Yet such events have certainly occurred, and much more often than many realize.’ --- Unsettling concepts indicate frailty.\n\n‘Repeatedly through its history, the church’s tree has been pruned and cut back, often savagely.’\n\n‘Christianity became predominantly European not because this continent had any obvious affinity for that faith, but by default: Europe was the continent where it was not destroyed. Matters could easily have developed very differently.’\n\n‘We should rather regret the destruction of a once-flourishing culture, much as we mourn the passing of Muslim Spain, Buddhist India, or the Jewish worlds of eastern Europe. With the possible exception of a few particularly bloody or violent creeds, the destruction of any sig- nificant faith tradition is an irreplaceable loss to human experience and culture. Furthermore, the Christian experience offers lessons that can be applied more generally to the fate of other religions that have suffered persecution or elimination. If a faith as vigorous and pervasive as Middle Eastern or Asian Christianity could have fallen into such total oblivion, no religion is safe. And the means by which such an astonishing fall occurred should be of keen interest to anyone contemplating the future of any creed or denomination.’\n\n‘many aspects of Christianity that we conceive as thoroughly modern were in fact the norm in the distant past: globalization, the encounter with other faiths, and the dilemmas of living under hostile regimes.’\n\n‘How can our mental maps of the past be so radically distorted?’\n\n‘Much of what we today call the Islamic world was once Christian. The faith originated and took shape in Syria-Palestine and in Egypt, and these areas continued to have major Christian communities long after the Arab conquests. As late as the eleventh century, Asia was still home to at least a third of the world’s Christians, and per- haps a tenth of all Christians still lived in Africa’\n\n‘When we move our focus away from Europe, everything we think we know about Christianity shifts kaleidoscopically, even alarmingly.’\n\n‘When we speak of the medieval church, we are usually referring to conditions in western Europe, and not to the much wealthier and more sophisticated Eastern world centered in Constantinople. But there was, in addition, a third Christian world, a vast and complex realm that stretched deep into Asia.’\n\n‘At every stage, Timothy’s career violates everything we think we know about the history of Christianity—about its geo- graphical spread, its relationship with political state power, its cultural breadth, and its interaction with other religions. In terms of his prestige, and the geographical extent of his authority, Timothy was arguably the most significant Christian spiritual leader of his day, much more influential than the Western pope, in Rome, and on a par with the Orthodox patriarch in Constantinople.’\n\n‘Focusing on the Asian, Eastern story of Christianity forces us to jettison our customary images of the so-called Dark Ages. From Timothy’s point of view, the culture and learning of the ancient world had never been lost; nor, critically, had the connection with the primitive church. We easily contrast the Latin, feudal world of the Middle Ages with the ancient church rooted in the Semitic languages of the Middle East, but in Timothy’s time, the Church of the East still thought and spoke in Syriac, and its adherents continued to do so for several centuries afterward.’\n\n‘If we are ever tempted to speculate on what the early church might have looked like if it had developed independently, avoiding the mixed blessing of its alliance with Roman state power, we have but to look east.’\n\n‘Like its ancient predecessors, Timothy’s church remained thoroughly in dialogue with Semitic and Jewish traditions. Our accepted chronology of the ancient church is wrong: ancient Semitic Christianity dies out not in the fourth century, but in the fourteenth.’\n\n‘In contrast to the rigid homogeneity that is so often associated with the Western Middle Ages, Eastern prelates had to confront real diversity of thought, with daring mystical and theological speculations.’\n\n‘One continuing influence was the third-century Father Origen, who had proposed that the soul was preexistent and that salvation and damnation might be temporary states leading ultimately to a grand restoration of all things, the apokatastasis. At this climax beyond history, even the Devil would be redeemed, and all would share the divine nature.’\n\n‘Thomas Hobbes famously described the papacy as “the ghost of the deceased Roman Empire, sitting crowned upon the grave thereof.”’ (Reminds me of a vision of Nazgul)\n\n‘In England, to give a comparison, the medieval church had two metropolitans: respectively, at York and Canterbury. Timothy him- self presided over nineteen metropolitans and eighty-five bishops. Though the exact locations of metropolitan seats changed over time, map 1.1 on page 12 identifies some of the leading centers. Just in Timothy’s lifetime, new metropolitan sees were created at Rai near Tehran, and in Syria, Turkestan, Armenia, and Dailumaye on the Caspian Sea.’\n\n‘He reported the conversion of the Turkish great king, the khagan, who then ruled over much of central Asia. In a magnificent throwaway line, Timothy described, about 780, how “[i]n these days the Holy Spirit has anointed a met- ropolitan for the Turks, and we are preparing to consecrate another one for the Tibetans.”’\n\n‘We can’t understand Christian history without Asia—or, indeed, Asian history without Christianity.’\n\n‘In central Asia, the Christians’ main rivals were the Buddhists, who were then engaged in their own great missionary era. For many Mongol and Turkish peoples, Buddhism and Chris- tianity were familiar parts of the cultural landscape, and existed comfortably alongside older primal and shamanic traditions. So widespread were these Asian contacts, in fact, that it is tempting to see Timothy as a holdover from the great Axial Age in which the world religions were formed, even as he looks forward to later eras of global faith and intercultural contact. And the process went far beyond mere polite discussion: Christianity affected and trans- formed other faiths, and was in turn reshaped by them.’\n\n‘About 780, a Nestorian community erected a monument that recounted the Christian message in Buddhist and Taoist terms, just as European Christians were trying to make the faith acceptable to peoples of western and northern Europe: “The illustrious and honorable Messiah, veiling his true dignity, appeared in the world as a man; . . . he fixed the extent of the eight boundaries, thus completing the truth and freeing it from dross; he opened the gate of the three constant principles, in- troducing life and destroying death; he suspended the bright sun to invade the chambers of darkness, and the falsehoods of the devil were thereupon defeated; he set in motion the vessel of mercy by which to ascend to the bright mansions, where- upon rational beings were then released; having thus completed the manifestation of his power, in clear day he ascended to his true station.”’\n\n"},{"date":"2012-12-16T19:53:52.703Z","quote":"False","selection":"‘in 782 … Buddhist and Nestorian scholars worked amiably together for some years to translate seven copious volumes of Buddhist wisdom. Probably, Adam did this as much from intellectual curiosity as from ecumenical goodwill, and we can only guess about the conversations that would have ensued: So, what exactly is this “bodhisattva” we hear so much about? Do you really care more about relieving suffering than atoning for sin? And your monks meditate like ours do? Scholars still speculate whether Adam infiltrated Christian concepts into the translated sutras, consciously or otherwise’ --- I wonder if any scholars speculate whether Nestorianism picked up some Buddhist elements from this contact.\n\n‘Timothy said, the pearl of true faith had fallen into the transient mortal world, and each faith naively believed that it alone possessed it. All he could claim—and all the caliph could assert in response—was that some faiths could see enough evidence that theirs was the real pearl, although the final truth would not be known in this world.’ --- First Origen, now this, these Nestorians had extremely deep doctrines.\n\n‘It is common knowledge that medieval Arab societies were far ahead of those of Europe in terms of science, philosophy, and medicine, and that Europeans derived much of their scholarship from the Arab world; yet in the early cen- turies, this cultural achievement was usually Christian and Jewish rather than Muslim. It was Christians—Nestorian, Jacobite, Orthodox, and others—who preserved and translated the cultural inheritance of the ancient world—the science, philosophy, and medicine—and who transmitted it to centers like Baghdad and Damascus. Much of what we call Arab scholarship was in reality Syriac, Persian, and Coptic, and it was not necessarily Muslim. Syriac-speaking Christian schol- ars brought the works of Aristotle to the Muslim world: Timothy himself translated Aristotle’s Topics from Syriac into Arabic, at the behest of the caliph. Syriac Christians even make the first reference to the efficient Indian numbering system that we know today as “Arabic,” and long before this technique gained currency among Muslim thinkers.’\n\n‘Latin Europe’s low point came soon after 900 when, within the space of a couple of years, areas of central France were ravaged in quick succession by pagan Vikings from the north, Muslim Moors from the south, and pagan Magyars from the east: Christians had nowhere left to hide. Perhaps history would ultimately write off the Christian venture into western Europe as rash overreach, a diversion from Christianity’s natural destiny, which evidently lay in Asia. Europe might have been a continent too far.’\n\n‘While most Christians in Europe certainly lived in a kind of “Christendom,” in which church and state could be seen as broadly identical, that was far from the reality facing the millions of Christians who lived under other and possibly hostile faiths, under Persian, Muslim, Hindu, or Chi- nese rule. These believers were well accustomed to a modern idea of Christianity as a minority faith operating far from centers of power, usually suffering official discrimination, and facing the recurrent danger of persecution. About 1420, an Italian traveler observed that “[t]hese Nestorians are scattered all over India, in like manner as are the Jews among us.”20 He found it hard to grasp the idea of Chris- tians as a scattered group living among many other creeds, probably as a small minority.’\n\n‘Asia Minor, the region that is so often mentioned throughout the New Testament: it is here that we find such historic names as Iconium and Ephesus, Galatia and Bithynia, the seven cities of the book of Revelation. Still in 1050, the region had 373 bishoprics, and the in- habitants were virtually all Christian, overwhelmingly members of the Orthodox Church. Four hundred years later, that Christian pro- portion had fallen to 10 or 15 percent of the population’\n\n‘unlike Islam, Christianity has not retained its original foundation, in that its original homeland—the region where it enjoyed its greatest triumphs over its first millennium—is now overwhelmingly Muslim. To offer a parallel example to understand how radical the uprooting of Christianity was, we would have to imagine a counterfactual world in which Islam was extinguished in Arabia and the Middle East, and survived chiefly in Southeast Asia, using scriptures translated into Malay and Bengali. Christianity is just as severed from its original context.’\n\n‘When a movement or church fails or vanishes, hindsight can make us assume that it was doomed to failure from the outset, and that it was never going to play a serious role in history. Yet movements that ultimately became marginal were not always so.’\n\n‘The success of a particular religion or faith tradition in gaining numbers and influence neither proves nor disproves its validity.’\n\n‘How Religions Die’\n\n‘When one faith succeeds another, its members will devote little care to the fading writings of a rival religion they may well regard as wrong, or even diabolical.’ --- In some contrast to the Chinese dynasties."}]}

They are also prejudiced against food that does not come from the five snouts. For example, although Mongolia’s rivers teem with fish, Mongolians mostly ignore them.

It is generally the children’s task to come out and hold the dogs down by sitting on their heads.’\n\nMore that Weatherford could have indicated: ‘Most meat is eaten dried rather than fresh, however. Mongolians do most of their slaughtering in the late fall, drying the meat so that it will last through the winter. Since animals do not give milk in the winter, meat is the main source of protein then. One cow and seven to eight sheep, or their equivalent, will get a family of five through the winter. In place of beef, herders in the Gobi will preserve camel meat. Mountain herders may kill a yak or goats. Herders cut the fresh meat into long, inch-thick, and several- inch-wide strips. They hang them on a rope inside the ger but near the smoke hole, which is airy. The meat’s moisture all evaporates within a month, leaving hard, brown sticks with the texture of wood. The meat shrinks so much that all the meat from an entire cow could fit inside its stomach when dried. The dried meat, or borts, is broken up and stored in a canvas bag that allows air to circulate, so the meat will stay dry. Borts may be stored this way for months to years. When herders wish to eat some meat, they add the borts to boiling water. The meat expands in size by two and a half times when placed in water. Borts is an ideal food for nomads.’\n\n‘Orom is the cream that rises to the top of boiled milk. Aarul are dried cheese curds that Mongolians bake and store on top of ger in the summer.

Sour varieties of these dairy products are considered good for cleansing the stomach.

When they left, the machinery to make manufactured goods and the consumers to buy them left too, and many industrial workers were among the jobless. In response, the number of herders in Mongolia tripled between 1990 and 2000. Ochir, an ex-timber worker who became a herder, summed it up: “In this situation, what do you do? Our national heritage is herding. . . . We live in tents in the countryside and raise animals . . . So I bought a few sheep and goats.” Not only are small herds always vulnerable, but Ochir had no idea what to do when things went wrong. He was not accustomed to plan- ning for tough times and emergencies. The Communist government had always done that, storing fodder for the winter, having the equipment to transport it to the countryside, and providing veterinary services. Ochir admits he was at a loss. “When bad weather hit I was caught completely by surprise. I didn’t have a winter shelter. I didn’t have enough hay or fodder.

Everything died.”’\n\n‘Increased herd sizes as well as increased numbers of inexperienced herders have contributed to the dzud disaster. Under communism, the gov- ernment controlled herd size. Since communism fell, herd sizes have increased as herders compete with each other. The Communist government also provided a market for animal products in other Communist countries, and ran factories for processing animals into useful goods. In recent years the market for livestock has suffered, so animals have remained alive, needing grass, that otherwise would have been slaughtered.’\n\n‘“The one thing you can say about the Communists is that they knew what they were doing,” said David Dyer of the Gobi Regional Growth Initiative. “That paternalistic attitude may have taken all self-motivation out of the peo- ple here. . . . They must realize that they must get together so that spe- cializations can develop: people to grow hay, some to market the products, and that way to spread the cost of the vet[erinarian] between several families.”’\n\n‘The Ministry of Nature and the Environment believes that the livestock economy will be threatened in the long-term as much by land degrada- tion as by dzud. It estimated in 2001 that 78 percent of Mongolia’s land was in a state of decline due to overgrazing. “Decline” means soil degradation, vegetation degradation, and eventual desertification. In the 10 years between 1991 and 2001, the ministry believed, the percentage of desert-like land in Mongolia increased by 3.4 percent’\n\nAfter explaining the Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path, the author trots out, ‘Considering this path, one can understand why Buddhism acted as a pacifying influence on the formerly warlike Mongolians.’ No, actually, I can't understand. I hope my ethnography never commits such crimes.\n\n‘In the wake of communism’s fall, other religions have also thrived. Among these, which include Islam and the Nestorian, Mormon, and Catholic forms of Christianity, the most important is Shamanism. ... Shamanists see divine force in all of nature. Father Heaven (Tenger Etseg), they believe, is in the blue sky that is visible most of the time in Mongolia, in the almost ever-present wind, in lightning, and in meteorites. Shamanists see Mother Earth (Gazar Eej) in trees, minerals, and plants.’\n\nI should look into Mongolian Nestorism.\n\n‘The three traditional or “manly” sports are horse racing, wrestling, and archery.

Knocking is never required, and it is not considered rude to arrive even in the middle of the night. Older or esteemed guests are met and seen off, if possible, at the door of the ger or fence, if there happens to be one. Hosts do not come outside to welcome younger guests. If the owners are home, it is customary for them to offer guests some hot tea and perhaps a plate of cheese, fresh cream, and candies (even if the guests arrive in the middle of the night). Guests should accept these offer- ings before beginning conversation. Then, the guest should inquire about the health of the host, the health of the family’s animals, and the quality of the grazing. Mongolians always answer optimistically, even if this is not realistic. The host customarily inquires where the visitor is from and where he or she is heading. ... While guests, even Westerners, are not expected to compensate the host for their stay, small gifts are appropriate. Large gifts can be perceived as insulting’\n\n‘In a year, the things they were encouraged not to think about became all-important, and most of the things they had taken for granted were gone.

The very cold Mongolian winters are particularly hard on them. Children form groups to stay warm, and they sleep either in apartment building stairways, luggage racks on trains, or underground.’\n\n‘Mongolians are also known for their sayings, which are short and easy to pass on. Sometimes these bits of wisdom are put in the form of a triad, or three-line poem. Some examples of triads are: Three endless: Skies are endless / Wisdom is endless / Stupidity is endless’ --- these people would like Pratchett.\n\n‘The “triple master- pieces” of the Mongolian epic tradition are the Geser, the Jangar, and the Secret History of the Mongols.’ They quote from Waley's translation of the last.\n\nThey conclude their book as such: ‘Since the fall of the Mongol Empire, Mongolia has been consistently overwhelmed by outside influences—either Russian or Chinese. Now, will it be overwhelmed by Western or global influences or manage to preserve its unique and beautiful character? The answer depends upon a commitment to honest, representative government and hard thinking about values and priorities.’ No, I think the answer depends on chance and fate."}]}

There was no such harmony between the Khwarazm-shah's ambition to conquer Eastern Asia, and the commercial interests of his subjects.\n\n15. The ease with which the kingdom of the Khwarazm-shahs was conquered by the Mongols (1221) can be attributed both to the internal state of affairs in Khwarazm and to the superior organisation of the Mongol military forces. The strictly disciplined Mongol warriors did not seek opportunities to distinguish themselves before their comrades but faithfully carried out the will of their monarch, or of the chiefs appointed by him. The commanders were only obedient and able executors of the will of Chingiz-khan; as the oc- casion demanded, the latter divided or combined anew the different corps of his army, and swiftly took measures to cope with occasional failures.\tOn the other hand, the Muslim leaders,-and in the particu- lar the Khwarazm-shah Jalal al-din-were capable of miracles of valour achieved with a bare handful of men, but were utterly incap- able of organising more important forces, or of holding in check the national passions within their multi-national army."}]}

In addition to such land connections, however there also existed another route to the civilized worlds of Eurasia---by sea along the coasts of Annam and Champa, around or across the Malay Peninsula, to the Indian Ocean. By the year 1000, as we will note, this route had become as important as the older land routes to the north and west of it.’\n\n‘Thus we can divide East Asia into three zones---one of rice, on of wheat and millet, and one featuring both a pastoral and a forest, hunting economy. The decisive line, however, was along the Great Wall in China and the Yalu River in Korea, which separated the settled farming folk of East Asia from the nomadic or forest tribal societies which lay beyond.’"}]}

Avdo MEDJEDOVIĆ sang a very deep voice, monotonous, unintelligible, and the fiddle almost and he did not play. I have argued that weak shock in fiddle, because the gig later learned, and that the song has surpassed the gig. Formed a blistering speeds (20-25 lines per minute, and sometimes faster!) Linguistic wealth surpasses all his lyrics Bosniac singers. Also, his characterization of the characters deeper, and during the song the characters change, grow, acquire the character of his works. It is a sign of excellent arts creation, according to Aristotle. Their stories MEDJEDOVIĆ placed in clear mythic circuits, and unusual skillfully used the traditional technique of duplication and parallelism, to deepen the meaning of their topics. Finally, his songs constantly refer to other songs from the tradition. Referentiality is a significant characteristic of the Homeric epics, and is also in close MEDJEDOVIĆ Homer. (Please note that U.S. researchers this essential trait MEDJEDOVIĆ formation are not noticed.) So-called catalogs and decorative themes (ENUM hero, collecting military, descriptions of beautiful, heroic uniform or horses, descriptions of sets), MEDJEDOVIĆ also makes perfect than any other singer. He was thoughtful, very humble and pious man, and its entire lesion extolled Suleiman empire of which it was dreamed his entire life. He deeply believed in the essential fulfillment of God's will, and in many of his songs, especially Ðerdjelezu and Halil Hrnjica, God helps heroes. Murataga Kurtagić in many ways is the opposite MEDJEDOVIĆ. His fiddle playing is extraordinary, and his melody constantly varied and modulated, creating distinctive technique that allowed him to sing continuously for eight hours. That any singer except it was not possible. He started learning the songs even earlier than MEDJEDOVIĆ, as a child, from his grandfather, Abdullah, who was an extraordinary singer. Though he sometimes creates huge lines at a speed of 20 lines per minute, he sings more slowly (average of 13-16 lines per minute), but he creates an excellent verses that shapes beautiful, and speaks clearly. Murataga never Taller his song, but he tried to express what is important (so formed and his teachers, especially the famed Suleiman MaKic Alihadžic RESA). Unlike MEDJEDOVIĆ, Murataga avoids formation of ossified topics, and are reluctant to use traditional methods of duplication and parallelism. He thinks deeply about each poem, and each of them forms a single action. I deliberately took from him some of the best songs collection by Kosta Hoermann. Murataga each of them is formed infinitely better! As the man was a true hero and role model was his Halil Hrnjica. He was much more realistic, and I would say, and wiser than Avda. He's had as many evils, and his life was full of hardship and struggle, and did not admire the empire, but a good man and junaènom. He is not idealized past, because it was clear that the poor, and then was difficult, and that the history of Bosnia is full of suffering and national calamities. Although he was a devout like Awda, he deeply believed in the eternal battle between good and evil, and he was aware that evil often prevails over good. Some of his songs have an epic real tragic circuits. Finally, Muratagine songs are also full of referentiality, and was, like MEDJEDOVIĆ, sovereign traditional epic skill formation."}]}

Far more is learnt by the exercise of the tongue which is necessarily active than by that of the ear which is nearly passive. It is a common vanity for people to say that they understand better than they can talk. Such cases are I believe rare. Generally speaking it is more easy to convey one's thoughts by signs and language to others than to receive their thoughts. The art of language learning is one that requires no superior capacity. There is not much difference in the ages at which different children are able to express their emotions and if languages were learnt as children learn them they would be found easy of acquirement. It is scarcely more difficult to acquire five languages than one and I have known many instances of five or more languages spoken with equal purity and perfection.’"}]}

McKinney talks about *the voice* of a work, original or translation. Who is doing the speaking, whether a contemporary ordinaire, a crusty old cowboy grandfather, Roger-Moore-gentlemen-of-the-Queen-circa-1975, Edwardian or Jeffersonian, this is a terrifically important part of a work, I realize. She mentioned some very interesting ideas about how classics are currently thought to need retranslating every fifty years (what is one being asked to do when one is commissioned to do a new translation of a classic? just a business decision on part of publishers and an opportunity for you to do something new?), and how in English the \"noble tone\" thought to befit a translation of a classic is the language of 100--150 years ago, due to the slow drift of language. \n\nThese two ideas popped up when she did Sei Shonagon's Pillow Book (many?) years ago, and now when she is working on Yoshida Kenko's Essays in Idleness. McKinney wound up rendering Sei Shonagon's prose in contemporary English because this author, who would come to be revered as one of the giants of Heian literature, one of the paragons of Japan's golden era, used quite contemporary, \"pithy\" language for her prose. McKinney compares Sei Shonagon's to Yoshida Kenko's prose, the latter written 300 years after the former and when the Heian era was already seen as the pinnacle of Japanese culture. Yoshida Kenko is found to deliberately try to affect the language of Sei Shonagon, language which sounded contemporary to Heian ears but in which Kamakura audiences must have heard many resonances of the past. So McKinney poses the question: if Sei Shonagon would be translated into contemporary English, how ought she do Yoshida Kenko? One problem any answer must somehow address is that I don't think the Anglophone world has a period that it looks back on with as much reverence and nostalgia as the Japanese over the last thousand years have looked back on the Heian. I don't think that Shakespeare's era might come closest but would still be very far. The closest analogy to the west one might make is how in some periods Europe looked back upon the Homeric or Classical age of the Greeks (or how the Classical-era Greeks might have looked back on Homeric times). So my guess now would be to drop the whole Heian connection from a translation of Yoshida Kenko and try to make it sound like (and I apologize) Roger Moore in 1970s Bond films (the gentlemen-of-the-Queen sociolect). Forty-odd years is certainly enough time for language to drift noticeably but recognizably. \n\nI should come back to McKinney's talk as I read \"Invisible Work\" on Borgesian translation, especially as she mentioned early on how the perception today is that, especially for classics, a translation mustn't introduce anything that wasn't \"originally there.\" The most interesting idea though is related to voice: she mentions how a contemporary voice, for example, encodes within it many assumptions that may unpardonably influence a reading. \"After a century, not only language but social mores and indeed everyday life itself have undergone considerable changes, such that conveying it in our contemporary English can often seem rather jarring.\" \"Contemporary language would have set up expectations deeply at odds with the style, the themes, the whole substance of the novel\" (Kokoro, 1914).\n\nYet another neat idea presented by McKinney is how a translation of a classic can achieve the classic status as an independent work of literature. Elsewhere here I have clipped a translator mentioning that the Polish translation of Winnie the Pooh wound up becoming a major impact on the Polish language (just how I don't know). Along these lines, we're starting to get used to the idea of retellings of older stories becoming much more famous than their progenitors---Disney films are an unsavory example, and while retellings/stories isn't quite the same as translations/classics, this certainly has a pleasant Borgesian perversity.

Unless we are to follow Jung in postulating an acausal principle of synchronicity, we must suppose that the I Ching serves to break down preconceptions by forcing the diviner, i.e., the reader, to correlate his situation with the chance set of six prognostications. IF these meanings were unambiguous, the overwhelming probability would be that the prognostication would be either obviously inapplicable or grossly misleading. Since on the contrary the hexagrams open up an indefinite range of patterns for correlation, in the calm of withdrawal into sacred space and time [and this is where Angus Graham starts to sort of really say something important], the effect is to free the mind, to take account of all information,whether or not it conflicts with preconceptions, awaken it to unnoticed similarities and connections, and guide it to a settled decision adequate to the complexity of factors. This is conceived not as discursive thinking but as a synthesizing act in which the diviner sees into and responds to everything at once with the lucidity which is mysterious to himself. The I Ching is not a book which pretends to offer clear predictions, but hides away in tantalizing obscurities, it assumes in the diviner the kind of intelligence we have discussed in connection with the Daoist philosopher (Drongze?). Opening out and responding to stimulation in perfect tranquility, lucidity, and flexibility.’\n\nHe mentions a 1933 Waley essay on the layers of the I Ching (children's songs, magic incantations, wide variety of styles and eras). (I thought a quote I had recently heard from Waley was in this but I guess not.) Minford says there only two questions about translating. ‘What kind of text is it that you're translating. Who are you translating for?’\n\nEric Abrahamsen of Paper Republic had the most fascinating and information-packed talk I've heard on the topic (or any topic perhaps).\n\n‘I interpreted a few weeks ago for a conversation between a British writer named Andrew Miller and a Chinese writer named Yan Lianke. And Yan Lianke is probably one of the best writers working in CHina right now, he's daring, he writes things that get banned or very nearly get banned. He has a conscience, he's trying to improve society through his writing. Andrew Miller is, I didn't know before hand, but a pretty well-known British writer who writes a lot of historical fiction, so almost all his books are set in different places and different times. And so they're having this conversation and Yan Lianke said to him, \"i think it's fascinating to see how mobile you are, you go all over the world, you write other people's stories you write other people's histories. We could never do that. Chinese writers could never do that. We have too much of our own history. We're overburdened as it is with the things we're trying to digest and write.\" And I think that that's at the heart of the problem. First of all, the Chinese writers are overwhelmed. There *is* to much history, there IS too much going on, social issues are all overdetermined and overloaded with political meaning and political demands. But more than that, let's see, how to put this---the thing that we want out of great literature is that it absorb our society, our surroundings, just little details, the language, and the writer by some alchemical process turns that into something that's both familiar and unfamiliar, that showed that in all its details is nothing that we haven't seen before, and yet in its whole somehow something that is completely unfamiliar, and defamiliarizes our self with our surrounding, and at the same time you feel that it happened to the writer at the same time that it's happening to you as the reader. You feel that the writer going into this story was somehow overwhelmed by it, somehow forced to submit to it, or inhabited by it or inspired by it, that there's for a period of time that the writer was writing, there was nothing more important to the writer than this vision of society or a vision of a particular character or this voice was just coming out of him. This isn't a very interesting insight, it's sort of a sophomoric view on what literature does but you don't realize how important it is until you see a society where it doesn't really happen very much. So I wanted to talk a little bit about what Marcel was saying yesterday about ownership of language. My understanding from what you're saying and the Spanish speaking world, is that there're writers fighting for control over the language, and all of society is fighting each other for control of the language. Whereas in China it's very much writers are fighting society, not just for control of the language but for the right to interpret what they see and the right to reimagine society around them---so in China of course it's a political issue. I'm not talking about censorship, because that's what everybody thinks about when you talk about politics in china, not a censorship issue but the idea that the right to interpret society and the right to own the understandings and the proper \"what's said about the way things are\"---that's a very political issue and it's not ownership that either the government or the power structures of the society give up lightly. And so this is not something that just exists within the government, it's really on all levels of society. It's the way parents tell their children, \"that's an interesting sotyr but you should write something about how grandma is really nice to you.\" Or you get to school and they write something about how the sky is green, and the waffles taste like barbecue And the teacher says, \"No no no no no, that's not the way waffles taste, and obviously, look at the sky\". By the time a writer reaches maturity in his writing, and is writing fiction, they've already had a whole lifetime of this reminder of \"This does not belong to you' That there are correct understandings of history, and of people, and of places, that there are correct interpretations of these things and if you stray from them---no one's really going to like that very much. Language too, language belongs to someone, and it does not belong to writers. And writers who take the language for themselves and say \"I'm going to take this and make something completely new and it's going to scare the hell out of you and its going to be something that you have never seen before and yet is strangely familiar.\" People often will see that and say \"You're not supposed to write this way, this is not the way, this is not Chinese, you're not allowed to do this.\" So it happens anyway, but it's very, very rare and the writers who do it like Yan Lianke tend to be very mentally conflicted and they have an inbred sense of guilt like \"I've taken something that didn't belong to me but I HAD to take it because I'm a writer and I couldn't do anything else, but then everyone's looking at me.\" So it creates an internal tension in these writers. That's what I wanted to say about the general atmosphere in which a lot of these writers are working.‘\n\nThen:\n\n‘So in this particular excerpt, language-wise there's nothing really that leaps out and grabs you. And that was the point, that was the first thing that attracted me to this. It's in the story that he really does something impressive, and what he does manage to in the language is to leave out EVERYTHING that doesn't have anything to do with the story. Which, if you've read a lot of contemporary Chinese literature, that's a pretty good feat. Everyone feels that they have to shovel in as many adjectives as possible  and all the metaphors---pile it up, pile it up. And here he makes use of the Chinese ability to be concise. To leave out all the grammatical particles. You can just cram nouns and verbs together and good luck to the reader. The rest of it is on you. So in terms of his language, it is impressive because of its concision. In terms of the story, I thought he did a pretty amazing thing by writing a story about ... he runs around and has all these wonderful adventures. Nothing in this story indicates any moral stance on the part of the author. And I want to impress how amazing this is for a Chinese writer, especially somebody writing about the lower reaches of society---criminals essentially. Nothing in there says \"this is good\" or \"this is bad\" or \"I approve and don't approve.\" And I think that caused him a lot of difficultly within the literary establishment because people want that... It's the inability to let go of interpretations and ideas and a society-wide awareness of the potential threat within a story, just within a story, or just within language  is really really very present in a way that seems a little maybe archaic or even unimaginable to people moving within the international literary scene.’\n\nHe talks about a story called ‘The Wee Small Hours of 1993’ by Lu Yang (http://paper-republic.org/authors/lu-yang/):\n\n‘the potential of the Chinese language not only for concision but for the overload of meaning within individual characters, and the freedom from the grammatical structures that are required by English and French, that if you want to, you can write as unclearly as you want, and of course if you're unclear in an artistic way it can be brilliant. ... He mixes a bit of that classical Chinese ability to be imprecise with a little bit of learned Western writing structure.’"}]}

I used a long wideband chirp just because that's what we use in synthetic aperture *radars* for imaging...\n\nSo my experiment just told me that I need to do more experimentation to see if, between a good microphone and a good speaker (\"good\" meaning well-characterized), I can even get enough SNR to achieve the theoretical range resolutions ($c / (2 B)$ is the equation usually thrown around, so 343 meters per second / (2 * 15 KHz), a bit more than 1 centimeter resolution, which itself might be too low for book dewarping without super-resolution signal processing). And if that's possible, then the question is \n- can one get 20 of these microphones and one of these speakers comfortably mounted around a camera (iPhone?) or alternatively use a motor to drive a single microphone around a loop, and \n- either record all 20 channels at once (ideal) or sweep through them all fast enough (with or without a motor), and\n- deal with the parallax problem (the sonar image will always be taken from a very slightly different azimuth/elevation angle than the camera image, unless you arrange the receivers in a rectangle around the camera sensor?), and\n- make it quiet and unobtrusive enough, \nto get good book dewarping going in the Bodleian Library.\n\nKeep hacking acoustic magic,\nAhmed\n\n[1] http://www.diybookscanner.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=788\n"}]}

Presently, nearly all of the publicly-held U.S. debt is of short maturity. At an overall deficit of nearly 10% of GDP and a primary deficit of about 6%, there is very little chance that the ratio of publicly-held debt/GDP, which has nearly doubled since 2008, will easily stabilize in the coming years – particularly if we experience another recession.

Originally it means not 'large' but 'enlarged', and in all instances may imply not merely size and strength, but an addition of power, beyond the natural, whether it is applied to the superhuman thirtyfold strength possessed by Beowulf (in this Christian poem it is his special gift from God), or to the mysterious magical powers of the giant's sword and the dragon's hoard imposed by runes and curses."},{"date":"2012-10-14T00:40:40.150Z","quote":"True","selection":"An example is eoten 'giant' 112, etc. This word, we may believe on other evidence, was well known, though actually it is only recorded in its Anglo-Saxon form in Beowulf, because this poem alone has survived of the oral and written matter dealing with such legends.

Similar is swan-rad, rendered 'swan's-road' in 200: the bare solution 'sea' would lose too much. On the other hand, a full elucidation would take far too long. Literally it means 'swan-riding': that is, the region which is to the swimming swan as the plain is to the running horse or wain. Old English rad is as a rule used for the act of riding or sailing, not as its modern descendant 'road', for a beaten track.

I suggest that Homer used a similar technique. Međedović transformed the music, the rhythm and the melody of traditional sung verse into recited verse. In his recitation technique that music, rhythm and melody inhabited his rapidly spoken verse. It is clearly visible in the written transcription of the verses of traditional and post-traditional singers. While the sung verses appear to the reader “less poetically attractive,” when unaccompanied by music and out of their performance context, such is not the case with the recited verse, which gains more “literary” and poetic value. Whoever had the fortune to see both performance modes,[27] will agree with me that the performance of a good traditional singer of tales is more interesting to watch and feels more authentic than the performance of a post-traditional singer. The post-traditional singer’s performance is more interesting to hear and read as it possesses much richer and finer diction.[28]\n\n"}]}

It always has the sound of the /a/ in mat/hat/cat.\nThen we have the frequent eo which is sounded - e+o but the sounds are run together, not said separately. You will be familiar with this if you have seen the films or listened to the BBC radio adaptation of The Lord of the Rings.\nAs Tolkien uses it in names, the /e/ in this combination should sound like the /a/ in 'hate', not like the /e/ in 'bet'. It is a much harder vowel sound. The reason for this particular pronunciation is because names like 'Éomer' and 'Éowyn' borrow their 'Eo' syllable from the word for 'horse' - eoh, and this is a stressed syllable.\nAs a useful rule for pronunciation we can say that OE vowels are pronounced more like vowels in German or French.\nThere are some tricky consonants in OE. As with the name of the æ vowels sound, it is called /ash/ but the word is spelled asc in OE where the consonants sc taken together have a /sh/ sound.\nThe cg in OE words like ecg (meaning an edge or sword) is pronounced as /dge/ as in MnE (Modern English) 'ledge', 'hedge'.\nc can also be tricky. If you see it in a text with a dot over it then it is pronounced as we pronounce 'ch'.\nSometimes g will appear with a dot over it, or italicised in a word. This means that it has a 'y' sound. This happens frequently when making past tenses in OE. A dotted or italicised ge is tacked onto the front of some verbs to make a past tense, as in gelædan (guided, led). In these cases it has a /y/ sound, so the word is pronounced 'yelædan'.\nUsing what you have just read, try saying this: Meriadoc gelædde þone eoh 'Meriadoc led the horse'.\n"}]}

Or food could be fermented'\n\n'Canning is vulnerable to botulism because it so happens that when stressed by heat, C. botulinum produces a spore that has an extraordinarily high tolerance to heat. Destroying this spore requires sustaining temperatures above the boiling point of water, between 240° and 250°F/116° and 121°C, which can be attained in a pressure cooker at 10 to 15 pounds per square inch. At normal boiling temperature of 212°F/100°C, destroying the C. botulinumspores can take as long as 11 hours!4 If the spores persist in a non-acidic medium after insufficient heating, they find themselves in an ideal environment: an oxygen-free vacuum, devoid of competition from other bacteria.'\n\n'it is improperly canned foods, not ferments, that can harbor botulism (except in the case of meat and fish, which require specific precautions, covered in chapter 12). Plant-based ferments are generally safe, protected by their native or introduced organisms.'\n\n'By analyzing blood and fecal samples collected at regular intervals through the study, researchers evaluated the influence of removing the fermented foods from the diet.64 “The volunteers were asked to exclude from their diet any kind of fermented food or drink, such as fermented milk and dairy products including cheese, fermented meat, and fermented beverages like wine, beer or vinegar, and also any other kind of fermented food product such as cured olives.” According to the researchers, “The dietary deprivation of fermented foods modified the gut microbiota and caused a decrease in immune response.” After two weeks, the diets continued to be restricted, but participants were provided with yogurt each day for two more weeks, with half given standard live-culture yogurt, half yogurt fortified with probiotic strains. Interestingly, neither yogurt alone could fully restore participants to pre-restriction blood and fecal counts. This only occurred after they resumed their usual diets, with varied types of ferments'\n\n'Ingested bacteria taking up residence in the intestines is the image suggested by Metchnikoff in 1907, and behind the subsequent healthful reputation of kefir, yogurt, and other traditional live-culture foods. But it seems that actually the scenario is a bit more circuitous. A 2007 research review in The Journal of Nutrition summarized that current studies “demonstrate conclusively that ingested strains do not become established members of the normal microbiota but persist only during periods of dosing or for relatively short periods thereafter.”55'\n\n'because of the genetic fluidity of bacteria (see chapter 1), the specific bacterial strains are not critical to maintaining healthy live-culture stimulation. What is more important is variety, diversity, and incorporating the bacteria native to different raw ingredients'\n\n'DO YOU HAVE TO AVOID ALL FERMENTED FOODS TO GET RID OF A CANDIDA OVERGROWTH? Candida albicans is a fungus (yeast) that is a normal part of the human microbiota, found in most adult humans. A carbohydrate-rich diet can encourage its growth and increased prominence. The most important dietary modification you need to make to counter the C. albicans growth is restricting carbohydrate-rich foods, meaning not only sugar, grains, fruits, and potatoes, but also certain ferments made from them, such as bread, alcoholic beverages, vinegar, and possibly even kombucha. But to compensate for the deprivation, other live-culture ferments, based on less carbohydrate-rich foods such as vegetables or milk, even beans and meats, have lactic acid bacteria that can help to restore C. albicans to a more benign role.'\n\n'as the days pass after baking sourdough rye bread, the bread continues to sour, suggesting that perhaps the genes of the sourdough bacteria are taken up by new viable bacteria that continue the sourdough’s metabolism of carbohydrates into lactic acid. “For the most part, it is assumed that the active component of probiotic products is viable bacteria,” noted a paper published in the Journal of Nutrition as part of a Symposium on Probiotic Bacteria. “However, the literature suggests several situations in which viability is not required.”66'\n\n'Often, fermented meat and fish are not cooked at all. ... some of the transformations wrought by fermentation can substitute for or supersede some of the changes produced by cooking'\n\n'For people who are squeamish about stinky cheeses, it is usually because they associate the smell and appearance of the cheese with food that is rotting and no longer fit to be eaten. McGee describes fermentation as “controlled spoilage” and observes:\nIn cheese, animal fats and proteins are broken down into highly odorous molecules. Many of the same molecules are also produced during uncontrolled spoilage, as well as by microbial activity in the digestive tract and on moist, warm, sheltered areas of human skin. An aversion to the odor of decay has the obvious biological value of steering us away from possible food poisoning, so it’s no wonder that an animal food that gives off whiffs of shoes and soil and the stable takes some getting used to. Once acquired, however, the taste for partial spoilage can become a passion, an embrace of the earthy side of life that expresses itself best in paradoxes.73'\n\n'Please do not take the idea that the boundary between fermented and rotten is blurry and slippery as a suggestion to start eating anything you would previously have rejected as rotten. Learning a sense of boundaries around what it is appropriate to eat is necessary for survival. But precisely where we lay those boundaries is highly subjective, and largely culturally determined.'\n\n'Like the stinky cheese, the fermented fish requires an acquired taste, and perhaps an acquired microbial ecology. One culture’s greatest culinary achievement is sometimes another’s nightmare. And usually, both involve fermentation.'\n\n'make something delicious each time, acknowledging that the qualities manifested by each batch of kombucha, or bread, or yogurt will be different, and that this is something to be celebrated. It’s a tough lesson to learn for someone who is admittedly seduced by the siren song of uniformity.'\n\n'Even though they’re insufficient, rules are good to follow. Culturing foods isn’t a purely mechanical activity, but being a bit careful and meticulous (and systematic) about it will increase your chances of success tremendously. Not everything in life is a stir-fry—an endlessly flexible, infinitely adaptable dish. Some things are yogurt—fussy about the temperature difference between 108° and 115°'\n\n'A tablespoon of yogurt culture is good, but a cup of it is disastrous. Two weeks at the ocean is not necessarily better than one.'\n\n'No two people will make sauerkraut exactly the same, even if they follow the same recipe exactly. The air they are breathing (and thus changing) as they chop cabbage contributes to the flavor of the finished product.'\n\n'while different cultures may subtly influence one another through the air over time, typically this is not an issue. Alcohol makers wish to discourage Acetobacter, bacteria that ferment alcohol into vinegar. However, these bacteria are virtually everywhere,' In the air!!\n\n'Unfortunately, new, more stable forms of chlorine—called chloramines—are increasingly being used in water systems. Chloramines—produced by mixing chlorine with ammonia—are valued because they are less prone to dissipation than simple chlorine. Chloramines cannot be boiled out, or evaporated at ambient temperatures'\n\n'I typically work with unrefined sea salts. Because one of the important nutritional benefits of fermentation is making minerals bioavailable, I have come to the conclusion that it makes sense to ferment with salts containing a broad spectrum of minerals, rather than sodium chloride alone. ... having had the opportunity to ferment vegetables with every possible kind of salt handed to me by workshop organizers, I have observed that lactic acid bacteria seem tolerant to a wide variety of salts, including iodized table salt, and are not particularly picky.'\n\n'when you are trying to catch some organisms from the air to supplement what is already on the flour, and aeration stimulates yeast growth, you don’t need the lid on the jar. Instead use a cloth, towel, coffee filter, or other barrier that will keep flies out but allow airflow and with it both oxygen and microbial life.'\n\n'Historically, and still in many places to this day, alcoholic beverages have often been drunk only partially fermented, lightly alcoholic, still sweet, and sometimes sour. Acetobacter needs oxygen and begins growing on the surface of the beverage, where liquid meets air. To ferment to dryness (converting all the sugars to alcohol), especially with slow honey- and fruit-based ferments (as opposed to faster grain-based ones), minimizing surface area and blocking access to air helps avoid souring.'\n\n'sludge of dead yeast (called lees in wines and saké; trub in beers) ... The lees are edible and nutritious, but we have developed a cultural preference for clarified beverages, and many people prefer to minimize the yeasty flavor the lees impart'\n\n'my motto is cleanliness, not sterility. Sterility is a myth, not achievable in our homes, nor desirable'\n\n'cork harvesting is not only sustainable—the trees are not killed when cork is harvested, and the cork rapidly regenerates—but the cork industry is credited (by the World Wildlife Federation) with protecting millions of acres of forests in Southern Europe and northern Africa that are critical habitats for a number of endangered species.25 Bottles corked with natural corks should be stored on their sides to keep the corks moist; if they dry out, they may disintegrate.'\n\n'A yeast far less famous than S. cerevisiae, Kloeckera apiculata, frequently dominates the early stages of spontaneous fermentation of fruit juices, even grapes. Yeasts capable of fermentation are everywhere, even if they are not the number one global superstar monoculture species. “Yeasts are a bottomless reservoir of biodiversity, with more to offer than the classical handful of species traditionally used or studied,” conclude Vaughan-Martini and Martini.'\n\n'Raw honey contains abundant yeasts. (Pasteurization or cooking kills them.) The yeasts are inactive so long as the honey’s water content remains at or below 17 percent (as it is in fully mature honey). But increase the water content just a little bit beyond that and the yeasts wake right up. According to the US Department of Agriculture, “above 19 percent water, honey can be expected to ferment even with only one spore per gram of honey'\n\n'If your honey is not raw, good air circulation is necessary, because the air is the source of the yeasts landing on the surface of the ferment'\n\n'import wine and other luxury goods, befriend the rulers by presenting them with specialty wine sets, and then wait until they were asked to help in establishing native industries'\n\n'Fermented alcoholic beverages exposed to air will inevitably turn into vinegar over time; acetic-acid-producing bacteria known as Acetobacter are present everywhere. These bacteria need oxygen in order to grow. In the earliest stages of fermentation, yeasts will always dominate in a sugary liquid. And during the most vigorous period of fermentation, even in an open vessel with a broad surface exposed to air, the constant release of carbon dioxide at the surface protects it from vinegar development. The potential for vinegar development comes later, as fermentation subsides. Drink beverages fermented in open vessels quickly, as fermentation subsides, or they turn into vinegar before long'\n\n'I picked up a yogurt culture on a visit to Japan in 2001 and have been harvesting it ever since. (I’m sure if the customs officer at JFK had seen it, I wouldn’t have it today!) I have a super-simple technique: I simply skim off any foul-looking stuff at the top, eat as much as I want, and leave about ½ inch in the bottom of the container. Then I fill it with whole milk and leave it on the counter for 24 hours, covered with cheesecloth. Every three or four times I make it, I move the whole thing to a clean container. No cooking, no stirring, no nothing—super easy, and it’s lasted me nine years so far! It makes a somewhat runny yogurt (although sometimes it sets really nicely—I haven’t spent much time thinking about what makes it set better, although I suspect it’s timing when to put it in the fridge just right, and something about room temperature too).'"}]}

The \"traditional\" way of looking at Gymnopilus (Romagnesi, 1942; Singer, 1986; Hesler, 1969) divides the genus into two major groups: the Annulati group, which features mushrooms in which there is a \"[v]eil forming a membranous to densely fibrillose, persistent annulus\" (quoting Hesler, 1969--the major monograph for the genus in North America); and theGymnopilus group (\"[v]eil absent, or present and fugacious, not forming a persistent annulus\").' Taxonomy is much lamer than biochemistry, evolution, and ecology!\n\n'morphological and molecular data (as well as data from mating studies). Collectors will need to document substrates with precision, as well as forest types, weather patterns, evidence of animal (especially insect) activity--in short, the fullest documentation of ecology possible. This way there is a more legitimate, though still unfocussed, hypothesis being tested: that the mushroom has evolved in an ecosystem and that such data will be integral to understanding the mushroom. Subsequent, more specific hypotheses will undoubtedly suggest themselves as the data comes in--including hypotheses regarding the morphology of the mushrooms. Perhaps the scales on the cap of one species represent an adaptation to drier ecosystems, handily holding precious moisture on the mushroom rather than letting it slide away.' Or perhaps we have neutral evolutions!\n\n'Korf documents a sad state of affairs in contemporary academic mycology: grant funding given primarily to DNA studies of a few crusty and poorly documented specimens in herbaria; the \"bean-counting mentality\" of universities and research institutes that prioritize faddish publications; the inability of fungal taxonomists to find positions . . . all of this in a field that was never highly popular to begin with and has been struggling to keep itself afloat within biology departments for decades. Some of these problems may be inherent to academia (this, anyway, is what my 20 years of experience in academic literary studies, where more or less equivalent problems occur, suggests), but mycology is very fortunate to have a large body of experienced and able collectors and enthusiasts outside of academia: amateur mycologists, mushroom hunters, and a large network of mycological societies and mushroom clubs across the continent.' The academy follows the practitioners.\n\n'If the science must wait for academics to do it, it will never happen.' Dunn's book said the same thing about nematodes.\n\n'What a potential resource for the science! But, as anyone who has been to a mushroom club's foray knows, the resource is only a \"potential\" one. The mushrooms are not picked with an eye toward documentation of ecological data; they are placed on collection tables after being hastily sorted and identified; the edible mushrooms are removed; someone may make a list of the species names that have been applied to the mushrooms . . . and everything is thrown away on Sunday. This is all very fun--but to be honest none of it, even the occasionally produced species list, is very useful to science. With just a few changes, however, the process could easily provide mycology with lots of invaluable data. I plan to make my suggestions for mushroom clubs more specific and detailed in further publications and in my lectures, but here I will paint them in broad strokes. At a minimum, three things must happen for mycological society forays to make more scientifically useful contributions: collection of ecological data, documentation of macromorphology, and preservation of specimens.'"}]}

Intelligence. Counterespionage. Covert action (also subversion)'\n\n'during the Kennedy administration (although without the knowledge of the president), the CIA hoped to spoil Cuban–Soviet relations by lacing sugar bound from Havana to Moscow with an unpalatable, though harmless, chemical substance. A White House aide discovered the scheme and had the 14,125 bags of sugar confiscated before they were shipped to the Soviet Union. Other methods have reportedly included the incitement of labor unrest, the counterfeiting of foreign currencies, attempts to depress the world price of agriculture products grown by adversaries, the contamination of oil supplies, and even dynamiting electrical power lines and oil-storage facilities, as well as mining harbors to discourage the adversary's commercial shipping ventures.'\n\n'Influenced by the Pearl Harbor inquiries, especially the way Roberta Wholstetter used the findings of the penultimate investigation of Pearl Harbor, the Joint Congressional Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor attack, to write her famous treatise on surprise, Pearl Harbor Warning and Decision, the 9/11 commissioners attempted to capture the context of the September 11, 2001 disaster.'\n\n'During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev also served as his own intelligence analyst.15'\n\n'the demand for current, original and even entertaining intelligence products is so great that the drumbeat of constant intelligence warning and analysis output may take on a life of its own, creating an impression of certainty, threat, and immediacy that is not justified by the contents and data used in the production of finished intelligence.19'\n\n'practitioners have even devised methodologies to help analysts avoid common cognitive errors.21'\n\n'what generally inhibits “imaginative” analysis is “the concept”: shared assumptions among analysts and policymakers of what constitutes rational behavior on the part of a potential opponent.22'\n\n'Prior to the 1973 Y om Kippur War, for example, Israeli officials based their defense policy on three assumptions: Egypt would be at the center of any Arab coalition against Israel, Egypt would not undertake a significant attack without a strong prospect of victory, and, unless Egypt destroyed the Israeli Air Force, an Arab victory was not possible. Israeli officials also believed that their intelligence agencies would provide a “war warning” in time for them to mobilize their reserves or even launch a pre-emptive attack, actions that would produce an Arab rout. The effects of “the concept” on policymakers and analysts alike was staggering. Even though they were equipped with actual Syrian and Egyptian war plans, reconnaissance photographs showing unprecedented force deployments along the Suez Canal and Golan Heights, a warning from a credible and trusted spy within the inner circle of the Egyptian government, information that Soviet personnel and dependents were high-tailing it out of Cairo and Damascus, and signals intelligence suggesting that their opponents were about to strike, the Israelis never managed to act as if they were about to be hit by an all-out Arab assault. As a result, the outbreak of the 1973 Y om Kippur War was marked by one of the greatest intelligence-command failures in military history'\n"}]}

No species had ever, in all of that time, gone it alone.'\n\n'the consequences of removing the species our bodies evolved to interact with, be they predators (as in the case of the cheetah), mutualists like the animals that once dispersed the giant American fruits, or even parasites and disease.

In the early days, it seems as though anyone can solve the problem, so everyone tries. This stage of science can go on for decades, if not longer'\n\n'It was not long before other researchers suggested that many or most, or perhaps all autoimmune and allergic diseases were the result of missing our parasites. Perhaps even depression was linked to the lack of worms, and some cancers too. ... When treated with worms, people with inflammatory bowel disease get better. Diabetic mice return to normal blood glucose levels.7 The progression of heart disease is slowed. Even the symptoms of multiple sclerosis improve.'\n\n'our bodies are the same, essentially unaltered from 6,000 generations ago, when going for a run meant chasing after a wounded animal or fleeing a healthy one, water was drank out of cupped hands, and the sky still cracked wide open to reveal millions of stars, white dots as unexplainable as existence itself. Our bodies remember who we are. They respond as they have long responded, unaware that anything has changed, as anachronistically as the pronghorn’s running or the megafauna’s fat fruits.'\n\n'Our parasites were the ether in which our bodies made sense. The presence of these hangers-on has long been as dependable as gravity. Then it happened, the great change. Humans began to live in buildings and use toilets, and everything, in the last few generations—a second on a day clock of life’s history—changed.'\n\nFeedback control! Eventual acceptance after initial resistance! 'The answer appears to be, again and again, that if the parasite survives initially, the body learns to tolerate it. A team of peacekeeper cells calls off the antiparasite armed forces. The peacekeepers balance the response. They reserve the body’s energy to fight another day against a more beatable or virulent foe. ... Perhaps our bodies produce more of an immune response than is necessary because they are, in a way, “assuming” that some of their response will be dulled by the worms.'\n\n'it is not just our immune system that evolved to depend on the presence of other species. It is the shape of our guts, the enzymes we produce in our mouths, and even our vision, brains, and culture too.'\n\nTheory follows practice: 'the slow pace of science'\n\n'He got out of the plane and the air was hot. He saw poverty everywhere. In the days that followed, he saw fingerless lepers, begging children, bus accidents, and a great and terrible disregard for life. Lawrence was also seeing the irony, though irony is not a strong enough word, of what he was doing. Much of the world, including Cameroon, remains unable to rid itself of the parasites that end lives prematurely and brutally. HIV, malaria, and dengue kill people, destabilize governments, and even precipitate wars.

He wanted to go there barefoot so that he might contract hookworms. Surely this wasn’t the best way, but if he didn’t get better, he would go broke. If he went broke and ended up without Prednisone, he would die. So he found himself in Cameroon, looking for piles of human excrement to walk through on the chance that in those piles a few worms might crawl into him, through the thin barrier of his soft, urban skin'\n\n'wild worms'\n\nI think of bacteria as machines...: 'We still view our bodies like machines, in need of a little hammering here, some welding there, and the occasional drop of some chemicals to clean us out. They are not machines. They are organisms that evolved in the context of other wild species, organisms full of particulars'\n\n'When we stoned, speared, or shot big predators, smaller predators did better.1 We used DDT to kill the pests on our crops and in our homes, and favored the resistant and insidious. We sprayed our crops and yards to kill the weeds and left the super-weeds to grow up between our rows of corn and out of the cracks in our cement'\n\n'It was known that antibiotics kill pathogens such as syphilis (we know that because when patients are given the antibiotic, the syphilis goes away). But what actually happened to the other microbes in and on us when the syphilis was dying was never studied. The appropriate technology did not exist. And, more to the point, for the medical research community the goal was curing diseases.'\n\n'Let us pause for a second to consider the possible results of their experiment. Perhaps our collective intuition is that those mice that had been treated with antibiotics would have fewer “bad” bacteria and the same or even more “good” bacteria than they had started with. In the context of human medicine, that is what our hope has long been. What did you think was happening when you took antibiotics? It is always easiest to assume someone else knows the answer, but in this case no one did'\n\n'Kill the germs and we would be healthier and happier, just like the guinea pigs in their giant metal worlds.'\n\n'No one studying germ-free vertebrates (rats, guinea pigs, chickens, and the like) considered this work on termites. In order to do so, they would have had to talk to termite people. Termite people do their own thing. They converse with ant and bee people only begrudgingly, and with people who study people even less. There are a few hundred of them and they are, largely, happy to focus exclusively on termites for the rest of their lives. Nor were vertebrate biologists particularly concerned about termites. Each group went its own way and ignored the fact that the two bodies of research had come to exactly opposing conclusions—one at the cost of tens of years of work and lots of metal, and the other at the cost of an ice cube tray. The difference in the results between experiments on termite and guinea pig guts is relevant to all of humanity. It explains what Reyniers got wrong in the context of Pasteur’s question. It is not that Reyniers made some big mistake, some folly of hubris.13 He failed in the same way that much of modern medicine does; he failed to put his question in context, whether of our origins or of our modern lives. He wanted to make the germ-free guinea pigs useful by making them survive, which he did. But in the process, he accidentally rigged the competition between germless and germy guinea pigs in such a way that it was nearly impossible for his germ-free guinea pigs to die.'\n\n'When antibiotics were given, the salmonella was more likely to invade their body cavity through the gut. In addition, guts were more likely to be inflamed. But when the native microbes of these mice were allowed to reestablish, the salmonella no longer found its way into the body cavity. It was repelled, apparently by the native microbes that compete with the salmonella and in doing so prevent the salmonella from establishing itself. Antibiotics, in other words, kill the existing microbes in guts (be they ours or those of mice), but make it easier for whoever shows up next to move in. If, by chance, that happens to be a deadly pathogen, the result is dead mice or, in our case, humans.'\n\n'Some of the indigenous bacteria are able to construct biofilms on a tissue surface, or they are able to colonize a biofilm built by another bacterial species.  Many biofilms are a mixture of microbes, although one member is responsible for maintaining the biofilm and may predominate.'\n\n'If you happen to get microbes that are very efficient at harvesting and providing energy from your food and you are hungry, they will save you. If you get those same microbes and feed them chips, cheese, and white bread daily, they are more likely to make you fat.'\n\n'Pasteur was right; without their microbes, our ancestors would have died of hunger and disease. Without our microbes today we might be thinner, but we would be missing key nutrients, and we would be at a much higher risk of disease.'\n\n\nJust as humans are robots' reproductive organs, plants are humans' external guts! 'For the ants, the fungus serves as an external gut, digesting the leaves in a way the ants on their own cannot.'\n\nThis seems chicken or egg. Mutualism can't be understood as farmer/farmed, landlord/tenant, etc. 'the idea that our bodies might farm good microbes, for our defense, came first from the ants'\n\n'The appendix makes sense only in light of our evolutionary past ... No one had considered the possibility that it [the appendix] played a role in dealing with microbes, but they should have.'\n\n'The students looked on, excited but dumbstruck. Bollinger and Parker soon believed that they had, in a few minutes on a spring morning, resolved a several-hundred-year-old question. They had figured it out. The answer was suddenly obvious. The appendix, Bollinger and Parker had come to believe, was a house for bacteria. It had evolved to serve as a place where the bacteria could grow, removed from the wash and grind of the intestines themselves. It was a peaceful alley. From that alley, they thought, microbes might also be able to recolonize the gut after an intestinal disease had wiped it clean.'\n\n'antibodies sometimes help rather than attack other species, and that the appendix was, for reasons unexplained, full of antibodies. Not only was it strange that this apparently useless organ existed in the first place. It also seemed to be filled with antibodies that the body produces at great cost. Why this might be the case was ignored.'\n\n'The IgA antibodies, he imagined, help the bacteria by providing a kind of scaffolding with which they can link together to form biofilms, a sort of commune of unrelated microbial cells.'\n\nGreat book name, Permission to Believe: 'soon others who had been quiet had been given permission to believe'\n\nHeresy to dogma, an easy path in extremistan!: 'soon others who had been quiet had been given permission to believe. Almost as quickly as a tide climbs up under the roots of mangroves, Parker’s idea went from heresy to, if not dogma, credibility.'\n\n'The appendix is a small incubator, removed as it is from the fast flow of the intestines (and the potential from infection by passing pathogens), a Zen garden of microbial life.'\n\n'It was a breakthrough to realize that our immune system, appendix included, might be helping rather than hindering the microbes in our guts. It reversed the false conclusions of decades of research in giant guinea pig chambers and suggested not only that we might benefit from our microbes but that over evolutionary time we had benefited so much that it was worth evolving specific antibodies and organs to make sure those microbes were treated well'\n\nHow could medical professionals, having presumably studied about mutualism and symbiosis and dense feedback networks in grade school biology under inspired teachers, forgotten all about them? Truly we are narrow in our thinking these days. 'Mutualisms were reserved for the ecologists studying obscure organisms (tropical ants and termites, for example) in faraway lands.'\n\nIt is impossible to say where the human DNA ends and bacterial and viral DNA begins. In our eukaryotic nuclei even! 'You and I are like the colonies of leaf-cutter ants, dependent on other species without which we would not be entirely whole. We imagine ourselves besieged by germs, but this is a mistake. Our bodies are integrated with the microbes. In cross sections of our guts, it is impossible to say where the bacteria end and our guts begin. The IgA antibodies fail to recognize our good bacteria as foreign. Those good bacteria are, to IgA, self, the same as any of our other cells. While this new view of our lives is foreign to the medical community, to ecologists it is familiar.'\n\n'A hundred thousand years ago, all humans lived in Africa. Then, one lineage of humans (one branch on the human tree) left East Africa and made it to Europe and then later down to tropical Asia, Australia, and eventually North America. In all of that time, no one farmed.'\n\n'the Amazon, like the Congo or the forests of Asia, was a kind of petri dish, bounded by the Andes on one side and by oceans and deserts on the others. In this flat dish, populations grew more and more dense until there were millions of people in the forests, all of them gathering fruits, and killing monkeys and birds.2 ... Populations would have grown until resources were depleted. And then what? When human populations grew in the Amazon and elsewhere, they might have simply met with increasing rates of death and war. This is what happens to bacteria. It is the reason that we are not feet deep in great piles of microbes. Or they may have spilled over into marginal lands, farther from necessary water or easily accessed food. These were possibilities undoubtedly encountered in some places. The other possibility, though, was that some populations might find other ways of surviving. In such circumstances, two “inventions” repeatedly appear in history: agriculture and civilization—bread and kings.'\n\n'although it seems clear that most groups knew many tens and often hundreds of species of plants and animals and their uses, the numbers of known medicinal plants may have been low until agriculture arose. It was with agriculture that the need for medicine to treat disease arose and so too the knowledge.'\n\n'Farming is hard and unhealthy.'"},{"date":"2012-09-10T21:36:46.447Z","quote":"False","selection":"Even today, considerable effort goes into convincing cows to “let down their milk.” As Juliet Clutton-Brock puts it in her book on the natural history of domesticated animals, “The cow must be quiet, relaxed and totally familiar with the milker . . . her calf must be present, or a substitute that she identifies with the calf . . . and it is often necessary to stimulate the genital area before the milk-ejection reflex will initiate secretion.”\n\nTime spent addressing people's god complex viz., technology and elation and ecology is, I think, better served taking about biology. Oh well: 'The domestication of the aurochs was yet another manifestation of our power for innovation and the control of nature ... We tamed the cow, but also, later, horses, goats, cats, and dogs too. We did it one coupling or slaughter at a time. It is easy to get caught up in this godlike act of transformation.

He had, he thought, good evidence for his theory, but some potsherds and bones were not enough, and so his idea lay fallow, until now.'\n\n'What is also possible, but unlikely, is that once a new gene arises, it becomes nearly immediately universal. The only way for that to happen is if its bearer mates with nearly everyone, or if nearly everyone missing the gene dies. Geneticists euphemistically call such scenarios “selective sweeps,”'\n\n'Our lifestyles changed, permanently, as did our genes. We were no longer wild.' I disagree with this hyperbole. We still have (a large part of?) the entire kit of primal genes that might be even immediately expressible (e.g., epigenetics and methylation).\n\n''Although humans could not, without the aurochsen as intermediary, eat grass, they could make more grass by burning and cutting down forests. They could also reduce competition by killing the other animals that ate grass.' And the aurochsen loved it! A very cool twist on the whole 'nature is love' meme.\n\n'We depended and would continue to depend on the aurochsen to produce enough food to support the great densities to which our populations would rise. The aurochsen would depend on us to make ever more grass and to kill everything that might compete with or kill them in those new grasslands ... With our help, the aurochsen that became cows outcompeted those that did not ... We killed those competitors for the aurochsen and killed their predators too'\n\n'At least twice (and probably more like four times) upon a time, aurochsen were domesticated. In each of these cases, Tishkoff has shown that individual humans who had the genes to digest milk as adults had far more children who survived to have children themselves than those who did not, and so on into subsequent generations.'\n\n'Imagine that we performed an experiment in which we fed every person the same foods in the same quantities. We could come back and check on their (or really our) status through time. What do you predict would happen? We tend to act as though everyone would begin to look the same, or at least similar, in terms of their weight and health. This is the premise on which nearly every diet plan, exercise book, and weight-loss show is based, be it the grapefruit diet, the all-meat diet, the no-fat diet, or something else. It is the premise on which growth charts for babies are derived. It is the premise on which most of medicine, in one way or another, relies. The truth is that we would still differ even when eating exactly the same food.

One man’s survival gene is another’s belly roll.'\n\n'Ten thousand years ago, all of our ancestors were hunter-gatherers, though they gathered different things as a consequence of where and how they lived.

For context, in a given year, cancer kills only one out of a thousand Americans, which is to say that if early humans were like modern primates, death by predation would have been 30 times more likely at any moment than is death by cancer today. More to the point, cancer tends to kill us after we have reproduced, whereas predators knew no such forbearance. Regardless of when humans escaped predation by making better tools or being smarter, we began like the other primates, eaten often and nearly inevitably'\n\n'The vervet monkeys have three words, “leopard,” “eagle,” and “snake,” which were, in all likelihood among our first words, the most important nouns. Close behind them, one suspects, was the verb “RUN.”'\n\n'This is one of the reasons cows and many other domesticated animals, such as lambs and even genetically modified salmon, are so susceptible to predators.13 Cows and lambs are not just meek. They are actually numbed to the dangers that once haunted them, too tame to flee even when the wolf or the butcher is at the door. ... Interestingly, not all domesticated animals have become so numbed. Horses remain twitchy, their tendency to flee ever ready, unbroken. In part, these differences reflect the traits we have favored in different domesticated animals. In horses (and other animals used in transportation, such as camels and donkeys), we wanted speed and power. In cows, sheep, and pigs, we wanted more simply milk and meat'\n\n'Among primatologists, Isbell’s idea has no precedent. But often ideas new in one field are accepted truth in another.

That visual and language abilities, both plausibly linked to our evolutionary relationship with snakes, were at the core of this early expansion is beyond doubt'\n\n'Our vision may have been shaped when we were prey, but its greatest effects came once we had turned into predators.' We make the best of the past\n\n'Relatively few of the truths we hold to be self-evident are held to be so everywhere.' None actually.\n\n'If their only purpose were to modulate our internal hormones and digestive enzymes our taste buds would have no reason to notify our conscious brain that something had been tasted at all. This is just what happens in our guts. As late as 2005, no one knew we had taste buds in our guts. It now appears that that is where most of our taste buds, or at least taste receptors, reside. ... Although they are triggered subconsciously, the effects of the taste receptors in our guts are visible to us. We can see them at work when we eat noxious foods that make us vomit'\n\n'That the taste buds in our mouths lead us to become pleased or displeased is because of our ancestors. Those ancestors whose taste buds triggered a pleasant sensation when they ate foods they needed to find more of were more likely to survive. The reverse holds for dangerous foods and unpleasant sensations. Like lab animals, our ancestors were trained by their sensations to chase after some things and flee others. Their tongues praised them into the right decisions: “Look for more of this sweet and you will be rewarded!” But they also scolded them out of wrong ones: “Put that plant in your mouth again and I’ll make you suffer. I swear to god I may even make you puke.”'\n\n'A honeyguide, when it has found a hive, will come to the nearest house or person. There it will call, “tiya, tiya,” flash the white of its tail, and fly toward whoever is lucky enough to look on. It will continue to do so until someone follows it to a hive. At the hive, it will call again and wait. With luck, the hive is low enough to be climbed to, whereupon the person, a gatherer of honey, finds a food that rewards his or her sweet taste buds and the honeyguide finds a taste that rewards its too (our taste buds are sufficiently ancient that we and the honeyguide have similar fondnesses).2 No other mammals are known to follow the honeyguide, and so every bit of its elaborate act seems to have evolved for us, that we might help it and it us to sate our respective taste buds.'\n\n'a useful food (corn) is farmed to produce nutritionally useless sweet high-fructose corn syrup. In 2010, more than 400,000 square kilometers of Earth were dedicated to the farming of sugar beets and sugarcane,3 an area the size of California. A similar quantity of land is dedicated to the corn used to produce corn syrup. ... Because we never, in our long evolutionary history, faced a situation in which we had too much sugar, we have no bell or whistle in our body that tells us that we have eaten too much. Our body’s demand for sugar is essentially infinite and irrational'"},{"date":"2012-09-10T21:38:10.687Z","quote":"False","selection":"'A case can be made for lichens, to be sure.

Then we left the sea and moved ashore, where salt is scarce. We searched it out, as did other species. Macaws fly to saltlicks, elephants walk to them, and pregnant women can sometimes be found eating fistfuls of salty clay'\n\n'We could be at the point of dying of high blood pressure—collectively\nwe are—and our taste buds would still say, “Salt is good.”'\n\n'Species of beetles, mites, and even fungi sneak into termite nests.\nThey hide there, in plain view.

The first is a proofreading capability. DNA polymerase has a separate active site that checks each base after it is added. It wiggles the base a bit, and if it is loose, it clips it off. This improves the accuracy by one hundred times, at the cost of being wasteful, since it occasionally clips off proper bases as well.

Both of these enzymes use the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to provide the oxidizing power needed for these transformations. The need for the special redox talents of NAD places an important limit on the amount of alcohol that may be detoxified.

Diseases were the result of the body itself lurching out of balance as a result of heat or cold or some other force. Breathing in bad air could bring on a fever called malaria, for example. A disease came with symptoms: it made people cough, put spots on their belly, gave them parasites. Guinea worms were the product of too much acid in the blood, and weren't actually worms at all— they were something made by a diseased body: perhaps corrupted nerves, black bile, elongated veins. It was hard to believe, after all, that something as bizarre as a guinea worm could be a living creature. Even as late as 1824, some skeptics still held out: \"The substance in question cannot be a worm,\" declared the superintending surgeon of Bombay, \"because its situtation, functions, and properties are those of a lymphatic vessel and hence the idea of its being an animal is an absurdity.\"\n"},{"date":"2012-09-04T15:23:58.469Z","quote":"True","selection":"Even if maggots weren't spontaneously generated, parasites were a different matter. They simply had no way of getting inside a body and so had to be created there. They had never been seen outside a body, animal or human. They could be found in young animals, even in aborted fetuses. Some species could be found in the gut, living happily alongside other organisms that were being destroyed by digestive juices. Others could be found clogging the heart and the liver, without any conceivable way to get into those organs. They had hooks and suckers and other equipment for making their way inside a body, but they would be helpless in the outside world. In other words, parasites were clearly designed to live their entire lives inside other animals, even in particular organs.\n"}]}

For example, natural communities have been likened to aeroplanes, and each species to parts of an aeroplane. A metaphor is then constructed in which the removal of a species from a community is likened to the removal of an aeroplane part. Just as removal of one or more parts will cause the plane to crash, the metaphor asserts that the removal of one too many species from a community will result in collapse of the community. On closer examination, this is seen as empty. There is no ‘aeroplane’. Also, the designation of certain kinds of species as good or bad – specifically, alien species are bad and ‘native’ species are good – is empty and misleading. While invasive species, in some cases, actually do damage native species, the generalization that invaders will reduce species diversity is not well founded.\" \n\n\"Fields that are required to focus on research defined by social needs, like ecology and medi- cine, rather than on scientific capabilities, like astronomy and hydrodynamics, generate reifica- tions. Reifications are dangerous to the health of a research area\"\n\nOnly ecologists would think support vector machines were sophisticated...\n\n\"I can tell you how to measure it, just as I can tell you how to count chromosomes. While I was in graduate school, human chromosomes were counted repeatedly as 48 until someone actually counted with a clear head and came up with 46. It has been reported (Pennock, 1999) that an ‘evolutionist’ biology teacher in a bible belt school had students count the ribs of male and female human skeletons in the classroom, so they could prove to themselves that Adam’s rib loss was not heritable. He reported that, over and over, students would mistakenly count one fewer rib on the male skeleton\"\n\n\nBeware setting up a straw man to be attacked, he might Turn into a marble statue, unmovable and worshipped! same with zen: \"I proposed the 10% universal value in the hope of propping up a straw man, a target. I did not reify it. However, it was a round number and seemed to satisfy a desire for a natural constant.\"\n\n\"1. Natural selection can hone the properties of individuals but it is much more difficult to evolve constancies in populations (Williams, 1966). 2. Ecological efficiency is a ratio involving at least three separate populations. For example, the ecological efficiency of an herbivorous trophic level involves food organisms, the herbivores themselves and the first-level carnivores. 3. Genes for a tri-specific property cannot be selected by any of the usual mechanisms of natural selection. So, I can imagine no mechanism for evolving constancy in such a triad of populations.\"\n\nAwesome! Gods = what has been written about them. Very Pratchettian! \"Writings about gods and angels include some of the most beautiful and, in one sense, the intellectually deepest of human creations, and are therefore extremely important. For these reifications one can build institutes, receive grants, fight wars and even die. Once enough writing and painting about angels had accumulated, it seemed impossible, at least for some people, to disbelieve in their empirical existence. Angels had been reified. What, then, are angels? They are the sum of what has been written and painted about them. Isn’t that a kind of existence? Yes, but not a scientifically useful one.\"\n\n\"Interpreting the parable leads to the assertion that removal of one species from a forest may do no visible harm, but if enough species are removed, the loss of one last population will result in collapse of the community. This is a beautiful and vivid image. The parable suggests that loss or addition of critical species will send reverberating waves of change through a community. Sometimes this appears to be valid, but is it general? In what sense is there really an aeroplane?\"\n\n\"There may be groups of species, each one closely connected to a few others, and only loosely connected to other groups. There is no aeroplane.\n\n\"Ruiz and Fofonoff (1999) estimated that more than 90% of alien species in estuaries have made no discernible impact on the native species diversity or species abundance distribution. It has also been suggested that some of the studies purporting to experi- mentally test the effects of invading species are subject to criticism on design grounds (Wardle, 1999). Levine and D’Antonio (1999) report a ‘consistent positive relation between exotic species abundance and resident species diversity . . . [suggesting] . . . that invaders and resident species are more similar than often believed’. It is as if some invasive species fit into niches that were in some sense empty, so that they are not strongly competitive with native species.\"\n\n\"As suggested by Sagoff (1999), if a species is not clearly a medical or agricultural pest, let’s learn to love it\"\n\n\n\"The central questions of modern genetics are defined by the applicability of powerful techniques. Questions that cannot be answered by use of these techniques are not of immediate genetic interest, although the development of new techniques is of interest to any science. The terminology of modern genetics refers only to processes or categories for which there exist operational decision procedures\"\n\n\"In ecology, such concepts as community integrity, benefits of diversity, natural efficiency, ecological services, ecological entropy and ecological health are all complex, in the accepted mathematical sense of having both real and imaginary parts.\""}]}

Contrast this with sexual organisms, where finding a mate becomes too improbable below a certain threshold abundance. Similarly, many small eukaryotes can also grow and divide without the need for a sexual partner and are not limited by being rare.\n\nAnother special property of the rare bacteria is that death is highly unlikely (6). The main causes of death for bacteria are attack by viruses that lyse the cells and predation by protists, the small heterotrophic eukaryotes that feed on bacteria or on other (generally smaller) protists. Viruses depend on encounter probabilities to find their prey, and thus if an organism is vanishingly rare, it is unlikely to be met by its specific virus. Actively growing bacteria are known to be bigger than starving bacteria, and protists selectively prey on the largest and most active bacteria (8, 9). Rare taxa tend to be starving and grow slowly compared with abundant taxa. So rare taxa tend to be represented by smaller cells and will be overlooked by grazers. Therefore, the rare taxa will persist in the environment for a long time. As a result, any habitat will have a very large biodiversity, formed by a few dozen abundant taxa plus a large collection of rare taxa that current molecular methods cannot retrieve (6).\n\n"}]}

Centuries before Taoism was established as an organized religion, it existed as a spiritual discipline similar to the yoga systems of India.

These ascetics aimed to become “Immortals” by developing conscious spirit bodies that could transcend death. But for most Chinese, this was simplified into the belief that Taoist masters achieved physical immortality.\n\nThe founder of Taoism is said to be Lao Tzu, who became known as a divine being. He is thought to have lived around the 5th or 6th century B.C., though we cannot be sure he actually lived at all. He is also supposed to have written the Tao Te Ching (“Book of the Way”), the primary text of Taoism and the most famous of all Chinese classics.\n\nIn Taoist literature, secrets of spiritual discipline were often coded in the metaphorical language of alchemy. Most Chinese, though, took this language literally. And so Lao Tzu and other Taoist figures were thought of as master alchemists, producing “Elixir of Life” and “pills of immortality.” Cinnabar, or mercuric sulfide—which I’ve used for the name of Lao Tzu’s palace—was a prime ingredient in such “alchemy.”\n\n"},{"date":"2012-08-16T12:05:38.060Z","quote":"True","selection":"Kwan Yin (or Kuan Yin, or Guan Yin).

Low man on the totem pole, of course, but the late Bernard Kilgore, then the bureau chief, let me write a few brief and inconsequential items now and then which the newspaper published.\n\nSo that means I have been writing for the Journal in one capacity or another for 50 years. A half-century is a span to spur nostalgia and give one to think.\n\nThey have been a fascinating 50 years for a journalist. They began with the years of the Great Depression and the coming of World War II. After a brief hiatus while I did some world travels courtesy of the U.S. Navy, they resumed in the Truman era when I myself served as Washington bureau chief. They have continued to this day.\n\nMy journalistic years thus embrace nine presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan. In that period there have been other wars -- Korea and Vietnam -- and other troubled times for the country. Several periods of inflation as well as other recessions, although fortunately none like the 1930s. All manner of public disturbances from the labor riots of the thirties to the race riots of the sixties.\n\nPolitical upheavals, too, as the Democratic Party dominance was interrupted by Eisenhower, returned with Kennedy and Johnson. Thereafter came Nixon, Watergate, our first-ever presidential resignation and our first-ever non-elected president in Gerald Ford. Later our first truly Southern president since the Civil War in the person of Jimmy Carter. Then with Ronald Reagan, our first openly avowed conservative to occupy the White House (for two terms) since Herbert Hoover.\n\nIt all began for me, amid the excitement of youth, with the on-going efforts of FDR and his New Deal to solve the Depression. All those efforts failed but my memory is clogged with remembrance of the colorful characters of that time now vanished into the history books. Of Henry Wallace and Henry Morgenthau, of Harold Ickes and his arch rival Harry Hopkins. With a bottle at hand I once \"struck a blow for freedom\" with John Nance Garner, FDR's crusty vice president. I remember standing in awe of courtly Speaker William Bankhead and in fascination before Joseph P. Kennedy, founding father of that enduring political clan. I knew among others Sen. Tom Connally of Texas, he with the flowing locks, Sen. Walter George of Georgia, whom FDR tried unsuccessfully to purge from the Democratic Party.\n\nAlthough I know time may romance years past, it seems to me their counterparts today are, by comparison, a dull and somber group. Able men no doubt but wanting the verve to make politics fun-filled for the spectators. Except perhaps for Tip O'Neill and Jesse Helms we watch only dancers in a stately quadrille.\n\nAmong the presidents of my time Harry Truman was the most likeable as a person despite all his troubles, Jack Kennedy the most exciting, Eisenhower the most underrated. Richard Nixon was a character right out of a Greek tragedy, a potentially great man with a fatal flaw. Lyndon Johnson the most tormented. Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford are the nicest men you would ever want to know but neither strong enough to wear the presidential mantle without stumbling.\n\nRonald Reagan, whose time is not yet done, is the most self-possessed of them all, unruffled by any slings or arrows. No one has ever called him a brilliant man. He is, rather, a man of deep instincts strengthened by long life and many years in the political wilderness. Those instincts, no different now than when he was governor of California, are for a nation less burdened by government and the taxes it lays on its citizens. It is an irony that he has come to preside over the government's greatest deficits and the greatest burden of debt. How President Reagan will ultimately be measured must await history.\n\nHaving been privileged to follow so much history-in-the-making I am tempted to keep a journalistic eye on what unfolds hereafter. But 50 years is a long time and there comes a time when time should have a stop.\n\nSo with today's column I will call a stop. This will be my last appearance in The Wall Street Journal under this familiar rubric.\n\nThis column itself is a quarter-century old under this byline. I inherited it from two distinguished predecessors, the late Thomas Woodlock and William Henry Grimes, both of whom were Editors of the Journal before me. For each of us in turn it was a way to keep a journalistic role without the daily pressures in a newspaper office. I am grateful to the present managers and editors of the paper for allowing me this little space to put forward such thoughts as I might have and to leave me unrestrained as to my peculiarities of style or substance.\n\nI admit to some sheepishness at this decision. After all, Woodlock was older than I when he wrote his last column from his hospital bed to be published posthumously. James Reston, older than I, still fills his place on The New York Times. And I am mindful of others who kept on in their journalistic endeavors long past my three score and twelve. David Lawrence, columnist when I began, was still writing in his eighties. So was Arthur Krock. Walter Lippmann outlasted the New York Herald-Tribune where he began.\n\nBut I offer no apologies. I fear the day when readers -- or those present Journal editors -- come to think I've outrun my time. Besides, I already find myself repeating myself. How many times can I deplore the government's deficit or inveigh against other recurring political idiocies without using shopworn words? Better to leave all that to younger minds which come afresh to age-old problems.\n\nAs it is, I can leave with a treasure house rich in memories, and not alone of presidents and politics. When I began in 1936 The Wall Street Journal was a small paper with a circulation of barely 35,000. By 1971 when I retired as the paper's Editor it exceeded a million. Since I left it has doubled, to more than two million in the U.S.; it's also published in Europe and Asia. How that growth came about is also part of my memory.\n\nThe chief architect of the transformation was Bernard Kilgore, the one who was my bureau chief so long ago. While many others contributed to this growth -- able editors, executives and pioneers in the printing trade -- his was the vision of a newspaper that could span this huge country delivering the same news on the same day to readers in Portland, Maine, and Portland, Ore. Doubters said it could not be done but the newspaper you hold today, better edited and more complete, is his monument. Other publishers of national newspapers came thereafter. Kilgore had the dream first and saw it fulfilled.\n\nAfter 50 years watching that dream being fulfilled I cannot just stop without regret. So I hope this is not the end of the story. I intend now and then to submit some offerings to the editors on various subjects which, perhaps, they will think worth printing. There will be no longer, though, the regular weekly conversations with the readers. I have grown too weary of mind for that.\n\nNot too weary to remember, of course, and memory is a pleasure that grows richer with age. These 50 years have seen much turbulence for the country. But for a journalist, let me confess, they have all been fun. So if this is not, as I hope, the end of the story, I am content that it be the end of a chapter.\n\nCopyright Dow Jones & Company Inc Mar 5, 1986\n\n"},{"date":"2012-08-11T03:21:02.107Z","quote":"False","selection":"There's not anything in Vermont Royster's last column to the effect that \"they can't find enough news to fill the newspaper\"!

If we like the characters, and God forbid care about them, then we want to see what happens to them next. Even if they're baking bread, or fighting 19th century vampires, or traipsing across an alternate-reality version of Earth where alchemy has developed into a kind of magic. We like these characters and we follow them. It's that simple.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of the time that simple rule gets misconstrued, and we are fed archetypes instead of characters. I would be much more forgiving of fanservice-y shows if their characters were more than jerk-off fodder - the shy one, the one with glasses, the tsundere, et al. I can't say I care about characters when I've already figured out what their character arc is, because I've seen it done a thousand times before.

Its great and lasting consequences are not those which had originally been intended; they were engineered by people who saw how to exploit the movement to their own entirely different ends. At the very time when the crusading movement was getting under way on a large scale, an element of political activity was already in existence in the towns of northern Italy---a factor which, having first proved its strength in the fight for independence against the established local seigneurial powers, now set about employing its newly-won freedom of activity in the service of the economic and political expansion of the town. For these towns the crusading movement was in point of fact a splendid opportunity for putting their commercial instincts into practice.

Each lesson series comprises a number of glossed texts (usually ten), each with a brief introduction identifying its author and the document from which it was taken, an English translation, and five Grammar points; other resources in each series include a Table of Contents and a Series Introduction, a Master Glossary of words covering all lesson texts, a Base Form Dictionary also spanning the texts, and an English Meaning Index to the glosses. Listed in order of [first] online publication:\n\nLatin Online [2002] is designed to teach you to read Latin, or to improve your reading knowledge. After completing the course, you should be able to read any Latin texts. You may find it easier to use texts with translations, such as the Loeb Classics.\n\nClassical Greek Online [2002], likewise, is designed to teach you to read classical Greek texts or to improve your reading knowledge. New Testament Greek Online [2003] includes some of the central N.T. passages; it is designed like Greek Online.\n\nOld Church Slavonic Online [2003] is written in the same format with the same goals in mind. Seven OCS texts are taken from the New Testament; two of these (lessons 6, 7) parallel texts in our New Testament Greek series. Three non-Biblical texts, from other sources, are included for literary variety. An annotated bibliography, rather than being included as lesson points 46-50 in lesson 10 as in the Latin/Greek series, is listed separately; see the link at the bottom of the OCS Series Introduction page.\n\nClassical Armenian Online [2004] is a collection of 5 lessons, with texts dated from the 5th to 7th centuries A.D. Again, the annotated bibliography is separate; see the link at the bottom of the Armenian Series Introduction page.\n\nOld Iranian Online [2004] is a 10-lesson series in which two related languages are covered: Avestan (lessons 1-6), with texts from the 10th - 6th centuries B.C., and Old Persian (7-10), with texts from the 6th - 5th centuries B.C. Each language has its own brief annotated bibliography. For Avestan, two dialects are covered: \"old\" (lessons 1-4) and \"young[er]\" (5-6). A short list of works for Further Reading also appears at the end of the Series Introduction.\n\nOld Norse Online [2005] is a 10-lesson series, with texts from the 9th - 14th centuries A.D. A separate annotated bibliography is included (see link at bottom of Series Introduction page).\n\nBaltic Online is a collection of 7 Lithuanian lessons [2005] covering texts from the 16th - 20th centuries A.D., plus an additional set of 3 Latvian lessons [2007] covering texts from the 16th - 19th centuries A.D.\n\nHittite Online [2005] is a 10-lesson series with texts from the 17th - 12th centuries B.C. A short bibliography appears at the end of the Series Introduction.\n\nAncient Sanskrit Online [2006] is a 10-lesson series with texts from the Rigveda, dating perhaps from the beginning of the 2nd millennium B.C. A separate tabular index to Rigvedic passages covered in the series is included (see link at bottom of Series Introduction page). After this series was completed, an online version of the full metrically restored Rigveda text was prepared; it is transcribed in Unicode.\n\nGothic Online [2006] is a 10-lesson series with texts from the Gothic New Testament and from Skeireins, together dated in the 4th - 5th centuries A.D. Half of these texts (lessons 1, 4, 6, 7, 10) parallel texts in our New Testament Greek series.\n\nOld French Online [2006] is a 10-lesson series with texts from the 9th - 13th centuries A.D. Grammar points 46-50, in lesson 10, comprise a short bibliography.\n\nOld Irish Online [2006-07] is a 10-lesson series with texts from the 6th - 10th centuries A.D.\n\nOld English Online [2007] is a 10-lesson series with texts from the 7th - 10th centuries A.D.\n\nTocharian Online [2007-10] is a 10-lesson series with a separate annotated bibliography; Tocharian texts are dated in the 6th - 8th centuries A.D. We believe this to be the first introductory Tocharian grammar published in English.\n\nAlbanian Online [2011] is a collection of 3 Standard Albanian lessons covering texts from the 20th - 21st centuries A.D., plus an additional pair of Geg lessons covering texts from the 16th & 19th centuries A.D.\n\n"}]}

Adding a simple counter to a Hadoop job becomes a chore of its own.\nDocumentation for the bloated Java API is sufficient, but not the most helpful.\nHDFS is complicated and has plenty of issues of its own. I recently heard a story about data loss in HDFS just because the IP address block used by the cluster changed.\nDebugging a failure is a nightmare; is it the code itself? Is it a configuration parameter? Is it the cluster or one/several machines on the cluster? Is it the filesystem or disk itself? Who knows?!\nLogging is verbose to the point that finding errors is like finding a needle in a haystack. That is, if you are even lucky to have an error recorded! I’ve had plenty of instances where jobs fail and there is absolutely nothing in the stdout or stderr logs.\nLarge clusters require a dedicated team to keep it running properly, but that is not surprising.\nWriting a Hadoop job becomes a software engineering task rather than a data analysis task.\nHadoop will be around for a long time, and for good reason. MapReduce cannot solve every problem (fact), and Hadoop can solve even fewer problems (opinion?). After dealing with some of the innards of Hadoop, I’ve often said to myself “there must be a better way.” For large corporations that routinely crunch large amounts of data using MapReduce, Hadoop is still a great choice. For research, experimentation, and everyday data munging, one of these other frameworks may be better if the advantages of HDFS are not necessarily imperative"}]}

I have only read two other (fully translated) works by Yoshikawa and the complexity of the storyline, the richness of characters, and the meticulous attention to historical detail have always been his strong points with me. I don't know that many would gloss over unfamiliar aspects of the Japanese culture, but to cut them out entirely is unpardonable. The impatient can skip, the truly interested must be able to follow the story as the author intended it. I speak no Japanese, but as one who deeply admires the culture, I feel I've been shortchanged. Further attempts to \"Westernize\" the novel result in patchy continuity, curious shallowness, rambling (as some characters come and go without purpose at all), and finally to the overtly ridiculous (e.g. sake becomes \"wine\")."}]}

All the young men and women of the village were out on the grassy hills with scythes; the children gathered currants in the wood each day, old folks sat at home and sewed furs together, the pitch-boilers and charcoal-burners worked at their black fires with barrels and scoops, and athwart it all came the message of war.\nAt 4 A.m. on July 31st the first telegram came through, an order to mobilise and be prepared for active service. I was awakened that morning by an unusual commotion, and, going into the village street, saw the soldier population collected in groups, talking excitedly. My peasant hostess cried out to me, \"Have you heard the news? There is war.\" A young man on a fine horse came galloping down the street, a great red flag hanging from his shoulders and flapping in the wind, and as he went he called out the news to each and every one, \"War! War!\"\nHorses out, uniforms, swords! The village feldscher took his stand outside our one Government building, the volostnoe pravlenie, and began to examine horses. The Tsar had called on the Cossacks; they gave up their work without a regret and burned to fight the enemy.\nWho was the enemy? Nobody knew. The telegram contained no indications. All the village population knew was that the same telegram had come as came ten years ago, when they were called to fight the Japanese. Rumours abounded. All the morning it was persisted that the yellow peril had matured, and that the war was with China. Russia had pushed too far into Mongolia, and China had declared war.\nThe village priest, who spoke Esperanto and claimed that he had never met anyone else in the world who spoke the language, came to me and said:\n\"What think you of Kaiser Wilhelm's picture?\"\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\"Why, the yellow peril!\"\nThen a rumour went round, \"It is with England, with England.\" So far away these people lived they did not know that our old hostility had vanished. Only after four days did something like the truth come to us, and then nobody believed it.\n\"An immense war,\" said a peasant to me. \"Thirteen powers engaged — England, France, Russia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Servia, Montenegro, Albania, against Germany, Austria, Italy, Roumania, Turkey.\"\nTwo days after the first telegram a second came, and this one called up every man between the ages of 18 and 43. Astonishing that Russia should at the very outset begin to mobilise its reservists 5,000 versts from the scene of hostilities!\nFlying messengers arrived on horses, breathless and steaming, and delivered packets into the hands of the Ataman, the head-man of the Cossacks — the secret instructions. Fresh horses were at once given them, and they were off again within five minutes of their arrival in the village. The great red flag was mounted on an immense pine-pole at the end of our one street, and at night it was taken down and a large red lantern was hung in its place. At the entrance of every village such a flag flew by day, such a lantern by night.\nThe preparations for departure went on each day, and I spent much time watching the village vet. certifying or rejecting mounts. A horse that could not go fifty miles a day was not passed. Each Cossack brought his horse up, plucked its lips apart to show the teeth, explained marks on the horse's body, mounted it bareback and showed its paces. The examination was strict; the Cossacks had a thousand miles to go to get to the railway at Omsk. It was necessary to have strong horses.\nOn the Saturday night there was a melancholy service in the wooden village church. The priest, in a long sermon, looked back over the history of Holy Russia, dwelling chiefly on the occasion when Napoleon defiled the churches of \"Old Mother Moscow,\" and was punished by God. \"God is with us,\" said the priest. \"Victory will be ours.\"\nSunday was a holiday, and no preparations were made that day. On Monday the examination of horses went on. The Cossacks brought also their uniforms, swords, hats, half-shubas, overcoats, shirts, boots, belts — all that they were supposed to provide in the way of kit, and the Ataman checked and certified each soldier's portion.\nOn Thursday, the day of setting out, there came a third telegram from St. Petersburg. The vodka-shop, which had been locked and sealed during the great temperance struggle which had been in progress in Russia, might be opened for one day only — the day of mobilisation. After that day, however, it was to be closed again and remain closed until further orders."}]}

They do ask that question, I know; and it is not one to be rashly or idly answered. But that question is hardly evidence of “unblunted belief,” or even of the desire for it. Most often it proceeds from the child's desire to know which kind of literature he is faced with. Children's knowledge of the world is often so small that they cannot judge, off-hand and without help, between the fantastic, the strange (that is rare or remote facts), the nonsensical, and the merely “grown-up” (that is ordinary things of their parents' world, much of which still remains unexplored). But they recognize the different classes, and may like all of them at times. Of course the borders between them are often fluctuating or confused; but that is not only true for children. We all know the differences in kind, but we are not always sure how to place anything that we hear. A child may well believe a report that there are ogres in the next county; many grown-up persons find it easy to believe of another country; and as for another planet, very few adults seem able to imagine it as peopled, if at all, by anything but monsters of iniquity."},{"date":"2012-04-19T21:53:17.795Z","quote":"False","selection":"Children are capable, of course, of literary belief, when the story-maker's art is good enough to produce it. That state of mind has been called “willing suspension of disbelief.” But this does not seem to me a good description of what happens. What really happens is that the story-maker proves a successful “sub-creator.” He makes a Secondary World which your mind can enter. Inside it, what he relates is “true”: it accords with the laws of that world. You therefore believe it, while you are, as it were, inside. The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the magic, or rather art, has failed. You are then out in the Primary World again, looking at the little abortive Secondary World from outside. If you are obliged, by kindliness or circumstance, to stay, then disbelief must be suspended (or stifled), otherwise listening and looking would become intolerable. But this suspension of disbelief is a substitute for the genuine thing, a subterfuge we use when condescending to games or make-believe, or when trying (more or less willingly) to find what virtue we can in the work of an art that has for us failed.\n\nA real enthusiast for cricket is in the enchanted state: Secondary Belief. I, when I watch a match, am on the lower level. I can achieve (more or less) willing suspension of disbelief, when I am held there and supported by some other motive that will keep away boredom: for instance, a wild, heraldic, preference for dark blue rather than light. This suspension of disbelief may thus be a somewhat tired, shabby, or sentimental state of mind, and so lean to the “adult.” I fancy it is often the state of adults in the presence of a fairy-story. They are held there and supported by sentiment (memories of childhood, or notions of what childhood ought to be like); they think they ought to like the tale. But if they really liked it, for itself, they would not have to suspend disbelief: they would believe—in this sense.\n\nNow if Lang had meant anything like this there might have been some truth in his words. It may be argued that it is easier to work the spell with children. Perhaps it is, though I am not sure of this. The appearance that it is so is often, I think, an adult illusion produced by children's humility, their lack of critical experience and vocabulary, and their voracity (proper to their rapid growth). They like or try to like what is given to them: if they do not like it, they cannot well express their dislike or give reasons for it (and so may conceal it); and they like a great mass of different things indiscriminately, without troubling to analyse the planes of their belief. In any case I doubt if this potion—the enchantment of the effective fairy-story— is really one of the kind that becomes “blunted” by use, less potent after repeated draughts."},{"date":"2012-04-19T21:56:27.880Z","quote":"False","selection":"Actually, the association of children and fairy-stories is an accident of our domestic history. Fairy-stories have in the modern lettered world been relegated to the “nursery,” as shabby or old-fashioned furniture is relegated to the play-room, primarily because the adults do not want it, and do not mind if it is misused. It is not the choice of the children which decides this. Children as a class—except in a common lack of experience they are not one—neither like fairy-stories more, nor understand them better than adults do; and no more than they like many other things. They are young and growing, and normally have keen appetites, so the fairy-stories as a rule go down well enough. But in fact only some children, and some adults, have any special taste for them; and when they have it, it is not exclusive, nor even necessarily dominant.

Most debates depend on an attempt (by one or both sides) at over-simplification; and I do not suppose that this debate is an exception. The history of fairy-stories is probably more complex than the physical history of the human race, and as complex as the history of human language. All three things: independent invention, inheritance, and diffusion, have evidently played their part in producing the intricate web of Story. It is now beyond all skill but that of the elves to unravel it. Of these three invention is the most important and fundamental, and so (not surprisingly) also the most mysterious. To an inventor, that is to a storymaker, the other two must in the end lead back. Diffusion (borrowing in space) whether of an artefact or a story, only refers the problem of origin elsewhere. At the centre of the supposed diffusion there is a place where once an inventor lived. Similarly with inheritance (borrowing in time): in this way we arrive at last only at an ancestral inventor.

Children were deliberately infected with a mild form of hepatitis.\n\nThe investigators defended the study by stating that most new children would become infected with hepatitis within their first 6-12 months at the institution. Although permission was obtained from parents, the parents were not fully informed of the possible hazards involved in the study. There is evidence that the parents were led to believe that the child would not be enrolled at the school unless the parents signed the consent form.\n\n \nEthical concerns: exploitation of a vulnerable group of subjects, withholding information about risks, coercion or undue pressure on parents to volunteer their children. [Munson]\n\nJewish Chronic Disease Hospital Study\n\nIn 1963, live cancer cells were injected into senile patients without their knowledge as part of a study of immunity to cancer. Since the investigators believed that the cells would be rejected, the researchers did not inform the patients or seek consent because they did not want to frighten them.\n\nEthical concerns: lack of informed consent, use of a vulnerable group of subjects. [Levine]\n\nSan Antonio Contraception Study\n\nIn San Antonio, Texas, a number of Mexican-American women participated in a 1971 study to determine side effects of an oral contraceptive. The women came to a clinic seeking contraceptives. Unbeknownst to them, the study was designed so that half the women would receive oral contraceptives for the first half of the study, then switched to placebo. The women initially receiving placebo were placed on the oral contraceptive for the second half of the study. Ten of the 76 subjects became pregnant while using placebo.\n\nEthical concerns: lack of informed consent, use of a vulnerable group of subjects, risks to subjects outweighed benefits. [Levine]\n\nTea Room Trade Study\n\nThe study planned first to obtain information about homosexual practices in public restrooms and then to conduct further investigation on the men who took part in the acts. The researcher went undercover and gained the confidence of the men by acting as a \"look out.\" The researcher identified 100 active subjects by tracing their car license numbers. A year after he completed the initial study of direct observation of homosexual acts the researcher distributed a \"social health survey\" throughout the communities where he knew the subjects lived.\n\nEthical concerns: use of a vulnerable population, reinforced image that social scientists use deception casually in research, lack of informed consent. [Warwick]\n\n\nObedience to Authority Study (Milgram Study)\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine response to authority in normal humans. The researchers told recruited volunteers that the purpose was to study learning and memory. Each subject was told to teach a \"student\" and to punish the students' errors by administering increasing levels of electric shocks.The \"student\" was a confederate of the researcher who pretended to be a poor learner and mimicked pain (no real shocks were administered by the subjects) and even unconsciousness as the subject increased the levels of electric shock. The investigator told subjects who asked to withdraw from the research that the subject had to complete the experiment and continue to administer the shock. Sixty-three percent (63%) of the subjects administered lethal shocks; some even after the \"student\" claimed to have heart disease. Milgram debriefed subjects and reported that many believed the experience to be positive. However, Milgram also noted that many subjects were profoundly disturbed by their capacity to inflict harm.\n\nEthical concerns: The Milgram study raises ethical issues based on deception, undue influence, and debriefing. There is controversy over whether Milgram's work was unethical. Although not the standard at the time, an independent review and approval would probably have lessened the criticism that Milgram's work faced.\n\n\nThe Public Health Service (PHS) Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male (1932-1972)\n\nInitiated by the Public Health Service, this study was designed to document the natural history of syphilis in African-American men.\n\nAt the time the study began there was no known treatment for syphilis. Hundreds of men with syphilis and hundreds of men without syphilis (serving as controls)\n\nwere enrolled into the study. The men were recruited without truly informed consent. They were deliberately misinformed about the need for some of the procedures. For example , spinal taps were described as necessary and special \"free treatment.\"\n\nEven after penicillin was found to be a safe and effective treatment for syphilis in the 1940s, the men were denied antibiotics. The study continued to track these men until 1972 when the first public accounts of the study appeared in the national press. The study resulted in 28 deaths, 100 cases of disability, and 19 cases of congenital syphilis. [Levine]\n\nEthical concerns: lack of informed consent, deception, withholding information, withholding available treatment, putting men and their families at risk, exploitation of a vulnerable group of subjects who would not benefit from participation.\n\n"}]}

Perhaps we should not trust the scientist's evaluation of the crafts. Perhaps the men responsible for the development and dispersion of innovation in agriculture, metallurgy, and the chemical crafts did possess a developing system of general ideas which guided their work, ideas which were unrecognized by the scientist because they seemed so strange. But if technology possessed such an idea system, it has left no trace in written records or elsewhere. Once discovered, a process in which change may have played an overwhelming role, technological innovations were embodied in artifact and local practice, preserved and transmitted by precept and example. Migration and industrial espionage, not manuscripts or printed books, were the determinants of both the rate and route of diffusion.

The inhalation method gave to the animals doses that were only minimally replicable; in most cases the animals were not genetically standardized, and breeding protocols were ad hoc; and, most essential for a multigenerational study of health, conditions of care varied significantly over time... Recognizing the existence of these problems should not, however, lead us to dismiss the experiments as empty vessels into which biased scientists poured their preconceptions. ...

As long as agriculture held the place of honor with the Romans and they lived on their own lands they waxed strong and conquered all nations that opposed them. But when at a later date the farms were neglected and left to the care of slaves, and the freemen flocked to the cities, the Roman nation began to decay and soon sank into obscurity. Their conquerors were the sturdy Teutonic tribes of northern Europe who lived out of doors and were strangers to city life. The ancient Egyptians cultivated the rich valley of the Nile and made it the granary and the storehouse of the world. The early Israelites or Jews were largely farmers and shepherds, and the sturdy characteristics of their descendants to-day are in a measure due to this fact. In New Mexico and Arizona there are abundant evidences that the ancient Indians of those regions gave much attention to agriculture. They were good farmers and thoroughly understood the necessity and benefits of irrigation in an arid region. They made the Salt River Valley of Arizona the garden spot of the West, and one may find to-day in the country surrounding Phcenix many traces and evidences of the former irrigation ditches and trenches made by these Indians. They reached a high state of civilization and built many cities, the ruins of which stand to-day as monuments to their thrift and industry."}]}

On the contrary, every belief is reflected in all the minds of a given society, and it is expressed in many social phenomena. It is therefore complex, and, in fact, it is present in the social reality in overwhelming variety, very often puzzling, chaotic and elusive. In other words, there is a \"social dimension\" to a belief, and this must be carefully studied; the belief must be studied as it moves along this social dimension; it must be examined in the light of diverse types of minds and of the diverse institutions in which it cart be traced. To ignore this social dimension, to pass over the variety in which any given item of folklore is found in a social group, is unscientific.

The Forecasting Cultural Analysis and Simulation Tool (4CAST) will enable modeling of individual and group attitudes and behaviors. Analyst bias will be mitigated by: use of cultural primitives, timeline variation, semantic substitutions to Course of Action events, and other techniques. The result will be Monte Carlo simulations that identify critical event-chains that may impact operational plans. 4CAST will enable (1) rapidly access to a rich knowledge base of descriptive information about the society of interest, (2) rapid understanding of the potential influence of cultural factors on actions and effects of interest, (3) modeling and reasoning about the underlying socio-cultural factors that motivate and control the actions of leaders and populations, (4) identification of topics and areas of concern from a socio-cultural viewpoint so that planners can consider these factors when creating military, SSTR, and relief plans, and (5) generation of plausible futures that take into account the sequencing and timing of events -environment-related, socio-cultural, governmental, and military."}]}
